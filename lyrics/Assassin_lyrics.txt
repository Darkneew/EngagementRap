The Worst Old Ship LyricsThe worst old ship that ever did sail
Sailed out of Harwich on a windy day

[Chorus]
And we're waiting for the day
Waiting for the day
Waiting for the day
That we get our pay

She was built in Roman time
Held together with bits of twine
[Chorus]

Nothing in the galley—nothing in the hold
But the skipper's turned in with a bag of gold

[Chorus]

Off Orford Ness she sprang a leak
Hear her poor old timbers creak

[Chorus]

We pumped our way round scalby Ness
When the wind backed round to the west-nor'-west

[Chorus]

Into the Humber and up the town
Pump you blighters—pump or drown

A-weigh, you Rio!
It's there that the river brings down golden sand
For we're bound for the Rio Grande

Roll and Go LyricsThere was a ship, she sailed to Spain
O ho, roll and go!
There was a ship came home again
Tommy's on the topsail yard!

And what do you think was in her hold?
O ho, roll and go!
There was diamonds, there was gold
Tommy's on the topsail yard!

And what was in her lazarette?
O ho, roll and go!
Good split peas and bad bull meat

Derby Ram LyricsAs I was going to Derby, 'twas on a market day
I met the finest ram, sirs, that ever was fed upon hay

[Chorus]
That's a lie, that's a lie
That's a lie, a lie, a lie!

This ram and I got drunk, sir, as drunk as drunk could be
And when we sobered up, sir, we were far away out on the sea

[Chorus]
This wonderful old ram, sir, was playful as a kid;
He swallowed the captain's spyglass along with the bo'sun's fid

[Chorus]

One morning on the poop, sir, afore eight bells was struck
He climbed up to the sky's I yard an' sat down on the truck

(Chorus)

This wonderful ol' ram, sir, he tried a silly trick
He tried to jump a five-barred fence and landed in a rick

[Chorus]

This wonderful ol' ram, sir, it grew two horns of brass
One grew out o' his shoulder blade, t'other turned into a mast

[Chorus]

An' when this ram was killed, sir, the butcher was covered in blood
Five and twenty butcher boys was carried away the flood

[Chorus]

An' when this ram was dead, sir, they buried it in St. Joan's
It took ten men an' an elephant to carry one of its bones

The Coasts of High Barbary LyricsLook ahead, look-astern
Look the weather in the lee!
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we
I see a wreck to windward
And a lofty ship to lee!
A-sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary

"O, are you a pirate
Or a man o' war?" cried we
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we
"O no! I'm not a pirate
But a man-o-war," cried he
A-sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary
We'll back up our topsails
And heave vessel to
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we
For we have got some letters
To be carried home by you
A-sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary

For broadside, for broadside
They fought all on the main;
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we
Until at last the frigate
Shot the pirate's mast away
A sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary

With cutlass and gun
O we fought for hours three;
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we
The ship it was their coffin
And their grave it was the sea
A-sailing down along
The coast of High BarbaryYou might also likeEmbed

Windy Old Weather LyricsAs we were a-fishing off Happisburgh light
Shooting and hauling and trawling all night
In the windy old weather, stormy old weather
When the wind blows we all pull together

When up jumped a herring, the queen(king) of the sea
Says “Now, old skipper, you cannot catch me,”
In the windy old weather, stormy old weather
When the wind blows we all pull together

We sighted a Thresher-a-slashin’ his tail
“Time now Old Skipper to hoist up your sail.”
In the windy old weather, stormy old weather
When the wind blows we all pull together
And up jumps a Slipsole as strong as a horse
Says now, “Old Skipper you’re miles off course
”In the windy old weather, stormy old weather
When the wind blows we all pull together

Then along comes plaice-who’s got spots on his side, Says “Not much longer-these seas you can ride.”
In the windy old weather, stormy old weather
When the wind blows we all pull together

Then up rears a conger-as long as a mile
“Winds coming east’ly”-he says with a smile
In the windy old weather, stormy old weather
When the wind blows we all pull together

I think what these fishes are sayin’ is right
We’ll haul up our gear now an’ steer for the light
In the windy old weather, stormy old weather
When the wind blows we all pull togetherYou might also likeEmbed

The sailboat Malarkey

Tell me now what is this good boat's name?
It's the sailboat Malarkey

Well now, me boys, we are bound out to sea!
In the sailboat Malarkey

O when will Caroline come down to me?
In the sailboat Malarkey
She's lovely aloft and she's lovely below
Is the sailboat Malarkey

But she's best on her back as you very well know!
That sailboat Malarkey

Away, away in St George's Town
In the sailboat Malarkey

The rats come batting the houses down
Of the sailboat Malarkey

I'd give the world boys and all that I know
In the sailboat Malarkey

To turn and to roll with my Lucy-oh!
In the sailboat Malarkey

You pick her up, boys, and lay her down
In the sailboat Malarkey

And hang on tight as she bounces around!

Sailing o'er the ocean?

With her topsails all a-quiver
