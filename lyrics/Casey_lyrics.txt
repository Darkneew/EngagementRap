Tied Up Lyrics[Chorus 1: DeJ Loaf]
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I need a chick true talk, not fake with her walk
She got her hair done right, I be breakin' her off
I like them girls when I'm ready she be taking it off
She be tellin' me what to do cause she think she the boss
And I don't say nothin' to her, I let that money talk
We don't never trip much, we be shakin' it off
Win, lose, or draw, I back against the wall
I'm willing to grow, cause I've wanted it all
I'm one of a kind, she one of them dimes
Been at it for a while, we puttin' in time
I'm lovin' her thoughts, she changing my mind
We learnin' together, the stars align
Fly face, nice body, and swag crazy
She work and she goin' to school, she ain't lazy
And when she out and about, she look wavy
And when they try to ask what's up, she say Casey
[Chorus 2: DeJ Loaf & Casey Veggies]
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like
Whatever you like whatever you like whatever you like (she'll do whatever I like)
Whatever you like whatever you like whatever you like (she'll do whatever I like) (she'll do whatever I like)

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, shorty really rock with me
I took her to the block with me
She probably spent the whole night with me
Take a gold shot with me
All them girls flock for me
But she the one that's gone ride with me
We cruise through the hood, end up in Beverly Hills
We talked about how the lime light was never that real
She asked me questions about her sex, like how does it feel
Shorty you're the best, I'm just keepin' it real

[Chorus 2: DeJ Loaf & Casey Veggies]
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like
Whatever you like whatever you like whatever you like (she'll do whatever I like)
Whatever you like whatever you like whatever you like (she'll do whatever I like) (she'll do whatever I like)

Life Changes Lyrics[Intro: Phil Beaudreau]
I found love and I stopped lovin
Found God when I stopped lookin for one
Found a life but can’t make a livin
Don’t wanna find the end so I’m still in it
Still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
Nothing matters anyway
‘Cause I’m still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
If I’m moving on it anyway
[Interlude]
Yea, yea, word
Life changes
Ah man
Yea

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
How is anybody gon hear it if I don’t record it
New shit I’m driving yo I probably couldn’t afford it
Would be trapped in a hood state of mind, end up less rewarded
But I took a couple chances, now life is gorgeous
This gon change everything
Like a child, a funeral, or a wedding ring
But heaven brings angels down, now watch us while we levitate
Called the police when she needed, but they showed up hella late
I just do my dougie on these hoes
I’ll be dancing in the rain, soaking puddles in my shoes
Broken heart plus the rules, open art full of clues
Noah's ark, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther always knew it yeah
Life changes

[Chorus: Phil Beaudreau]
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait

All the new things around me and I really just wanna be comfortable
You know everything about me and that’s why I fell in love with you
I just want you to be down for me ‘cause I really can’t keep up with you
Times my mind be clouded and I feel I had enough of it
Lord I pray I live and grow, please just help me fight pain
I never jump to no conclusions and always know that life change
We never thought it would show up, sometimes God just invite things
But I’m moving at a good pace, just moved into a new place
On me you live a movie when you play a role and just do it
I just do my dougie on these hoes
I’ll be dancing in the rain, soaking puddles in my shoes
Hopped out the shower in a towel, then it dropped i told her pose
So I can snap a picture on my phone, so I can see it whenever I’m gone
Don’t wanna grow up but I’m grown
Don’t wanna blow up but I’m gone
Make sure it’s proven and known I wasn’t just the next rapper to be on
Young winners, we got it man, they smiled in our face and then doubted us
She made you love her then smashed your friend and let you know that it wasn't shit, life changes

[Chorus: Phil Beaudreau]
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
[Outro]
All the new things around me and I really just wanna be comfortable
You know everything about me and that’s why I fell in love with you
I just want you to be down for me ‘cause I really can’t keep up with you

This shit is schizo, tell a chick to get low

Your bitch is just like a frog and she just be hoppin' around
Whole squad be pipin' it down, that Peas and Carrots, That OF
Gun fights with no vests, get merked off when I blow checks
Ain't talkin' grams but I'm on deck, they talkin' grams I'm focused
This flow sick, you know this, she rolled it like a mosh pit
Imagine that, I hardly kick them braggin raps
But right now my swag is a bad ho, magnet
You hesitant and I'm adamant, can't stop this, got the locksmith
In the door, on the scene, cash rules and I'm making cream like

And daddy's absence was the reason why the swagger's this
Similar to abstinent ass and you ain't tappin' shit
Who rap rancid as rats acid with four and a
Half rations of horse laxatives down the hatch again
And dip fast as shit when all the cash cacklin'
Stanzas of them axes that him have to cut the chatter with
Hard as the wall of Clay Cassius that my back against
Hulk smash brackets that the masses try to stash him in
Half pans labyrinth, half black magic grip
Black flak jacket tap dancin' in a passion pit
Golf Wang cut and stitch surgical
Lips slurpin' that lit purple, my bitch circular
Not givin' shits like writers when its personal
Disgurstin' as dick burpin' when its vertical

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Oh shit that's the end huh
Aww, un uh man, I like talking shit, I feel like P. Diddy!7Embed

Faces Lyrics[Chorus]
I was that nigga back then and I'm still on top
When I had dreams of doing it big, now they real all the time
You been working for a minute and it still won't pop
Dropped my first shit on my own, so I'm never gonna flop

[Verse 1]
My chick super bad, riding super fast
Loaning stupid swag, cloning Cupid mask
Price as new as gas, paying, popping tags
So once he started to pop this shit I drop it off so fast
Million-dollar mind, billion-dollar grind
Benihana time, Ballade Louis style
Life's a movie now, with all that extra clips
I'm working and she's working
So we just text a bit, we just flex a bit
When she get some time
Swear I love to beat it up
But I really want yo mind, Hold up
Young boy, might have to slow up
Something 'bout growing up in California
With the nice trees and my life freeze
And the fans recognize me
[Verse 2]
My chick super bad, riding super fast
Lonely stupid swag, cloning Cupid mask
Drop exclusive flows, rock it you suppose
Cropping new designs, profit it in the stores
European shoes with the leather laces
Living with no limits, going hella crazy
Life with no limitations can make you go hella crazy
We be elevating, baby why you infiltrating?
Wanted to be a millionaire, holding on to my life lines
Hoping I can make a call, get some advice when the time is right
Baby girl, your mind right, you can do something different then them other types
I ain't willing to tell no lies, I'm just willing to tell them out

[Chorus]
I was that nigga back then and I'm still on top
When I had dreams of doing it big, now they real all the time
You been working for a minute and it still won't pop
Dropped my first shit on my own, so I'm never gonna flop
I was that nigga back then and I'm still on top
When I had dreams of doing it big, now they real all the time
You been working for a minute and it still won't pop
Dropped my first shit on my own, so I'm never gonna flop

[Verse 3]
My chick super bad, riding super fast
Lonely stupid swag, clowning Cupid mask
Drop exclusive flows, roll your juicy rolls
Popping new designs, profit it in the stores
My chick super bad, riding stupid fast
Getting hella gold, getting hella shows
Getting hella dough, got her hella faded
Momma hella bad, so I penetrate her
Why she infiltrating? We be renovating
Copping new shit, people hella mad
Why they infiltrating? You be instigating
I'm far along the road, seeing hella faces, hella faces

Can I Live Lyrics[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, yeah
Yo

The kid ridin' no insurance like whatever though
Say you got a bad chick, mines looks better though
Got her on lock, but I swear we ain't together though
She's just gonna ride with a nigga 'til I let her go
Rappin' what I'm livin', man, the shit I spit is medical
Soothin' to the mind like Cali green, that's medical
Young boy flyer than that time I ate a edible
Keep goin' up like a kite when you let it go
I be on some new shit, new chick from Mexico
Tryin' to have kids, I told her I wasn't ready though
Yeah, they ain't know me like shawty know
Me, Anwar and Joshton, they ain't no better than Shawty Lo
You niggas be playin' so I had to hit the audible
Touchdown pass, sold crack, goin' Roddy though
Rockin' that shit, got me lookin' like a pot of gold
Hit the jackpot, now we poppin', it's the party ho
[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
I just want it all, so I can have enough to give
No more worryin' at all, baby, I just wanna live
We can go to the mall, then we back to the crib
Then you can tell your friends that you relaxed with the kid
(Lay back, get it big, can I live?)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Live flyer than I've ever been, you just mad you never been
Bitches at the tele gettin' freaky like they lesbian
And they noticed everything I kick incredible
Mac Miller here with the homie Mr. Vegetables
Most Dope general, I know you see us on tour
Do a thirty minute set, the people want more
And that's an encore
The show run late
Bitches give me head tryin' to find out how my cum taste
I ain't talkin' about the jeweler, sayin', "Fuck Jake"
IPhone on me for my SportsCenter updates (Updates)
Oh, the Steelers won again
And groupies rollin' through, I tell 'em, "Bring a hundred friends"
It's good, we out in Cali, and Casey, that's my homie
We cooler than Moe Dee, it's easy macaroni

Got up his endurance about his cheddar though
Got the chick in her bare ass, uh, Plaxico
Rappers off that cheap gas, got that shit from Texaco
Rappin' 'til you're thirty, don't really know how to let it go
Yeah, my father had to let me know
Everything he did were situations to help me grow
As a young kid, little shit make you miserable
Now I'm grown up, told that man that I'm about to blow
Once I get goin', there's no stoppin'
They roarin', we're show-stoppin'
Wasn't even aware that my flow proper, but it is fosho
Once you make up your mind, man, you can get the dough
Just split up your time and clock in, you'll grow
I talk about upliftin' shit, plus all the chicks I hit
Plus the one girl I love, she know exactly who she is
Sincerely, rap's hope, hope you're hearin' me
My future's so bright that it's scarin' me

Me and my niggas was in the cut like rubbin' alcohol

I'm with them niggas in LA, that you know about, know about
From your girlfriend, word of mouth
But only name that come out her mouth
To the South, Texas state, yeah that's where my family at
Deep up in the country, homie, where people be burnin' trash
Rollin' by, feelin' hella good, I been up in Inglewood
Since Paul Pierce went to Inglewood, went from hood to hood
Love it there, taught me how to be a man
Hear them dudes rappin' 'bout it, but really they don't understand
I come from a little somethin' called the streets, taught me how to be a man
Hear them dudes rappin' 'bout it, but really they don't understand
Understand

Whoever needed that, they got it, next day they come back, they on it
Most these chickens actin' on it, lovin' how I'm tappin' on it
Niggas hit me up, yeah they lovin' how I'm rappin' on it
Said I will attack a track, and it's gon' need a rappin' lawyer
Charged before assault, look at all this shit I bought
I'm always tryna floss, and when I get I'ma do it right
Straight shinin' on them lames, from the mornin' to the night
From the mornin' to the night, I take the air, takin' flight
Yeah that's that LA shit, youngest on they playlist
Jordans and the gold chain, Illmatic bumpin'
But Nas did it first and now I'm 'bout to tell 'em somethin'
They all up in my face when I walk up in the function

Didn't mean to offend, oh, you're a lesbian
So I'm guessin' you don't really like to put your trust in men?
Who do I trust? Um, heroin addicts and
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, yeah I can count on them
Who is him? Signed proof in a suit
'Preme six-panel cap with the green brim
It's box logo this, box logo that
Usually a caucasian bitch swallowing a cack, oh snaps
I am spittin' like I got chipped tooth, pop some Prozac
Golf Wang, nigga, know that or that can
Turn into some necks, gettin' snapped up properly
Tyler Creator and Casey Veggies, fuck broccoli
[Chorus: Casey Veggies & Tyler, The Creator]
Girls come around, man they been tryna get it out me (Yeah, haha)
Niggas in my face, they don't know nothin' about me (DTA in this bitch)
Most these niggas fake, I say it loud, I say it proudly
We got money to make, and we don't trust anybody, anybody (I don't trust nobody, nigga)
Said we don't trust anybody, anybody (I mean, you can trust these niggas but)
Said we don't trust anybody, anybody (At the end, they fucking you)
Said we don't trust anybody, anybody
I said we don't trust anybody, yeah (No homo)[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]

Ridin’ Roun Town (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Ha haaa Ha haaa, yeah
Aww man, man, damn
One more time, yeah
Remix, remix

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
My life is full of lust, things will never be the same
Guess I should just keep that shit moving and accept the change
I'm a rapper dawg, I'm bout to cop a chain
Iced out, Veggies shining maybe then you'll know my name
Shout out my homies on it, specially from California
Man I be killing tracks, twenty years old writings on it
I got the connect, it's time to get a lick
I put my niggas on then we generating checks
This slow as a cancer, I need a sponsor
Or go to Avery's college and try to be a scholar
But the thing about it, got no dollars got no knowledge
I pray "God help me prosper, keep me from imposters"
I applied to school just so I can have some options
I need a couple mil, I'm trynna do it big
If I never get my chance least you all know I live, I live
Peas and Carrots, that's my niggas
We blew up, you a eyewitness
My broad put his finger on her trigger
If any of you niggas come try and get us
But only call upon the shit you want
She lookin' good and she got a donk
I'm a take her down and then wake her up
And then let her know that I had enough
[Verse 2: C-San]
Rollin' round the city with the homies in the Fo' Do'
Number 9 Jays matching perfect with the polo
Boxing out haters in my city like ?polo?(pogo?)
Girls with seven D's, double D's taking photos
Grab them cameras, let you know you ain't dealing with no amateurs
Ask your girl, bet she'll tell you all about my stamina
On the grind to the come up
Name through the city got me buzzin' like a liquor but I never pick a blunt up
Fly chicks all in the whip, you will never be ?
But she really just admiring the come up
Funny what these chicks'll do when you making moves
I had em' propped for Veggies, picked em' up right after school
This pimpin' nigga
Gems drop, better listen nigga
Chasing all these hoes will leave you cold
Better pay attention nigga
Flashing lights, lavish nights
If I hit it once, I'mma hit it twice
Cold game
Do it for my niggas trynna maintain
Got girls blowin' like coal train
Throw a couple in the air like Soul Plane

[Hook 2x]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico

Hit the eastside, the hoes call me Domasito
Crenshaw nigga, from Vernon ave up to Pico
We just getting money, I barely got time to eat though
Josh that's my people, Carrots get all the freaks though
Ridin' Round Town, I'm in the back while she's driving
Take me anywhere you wanna go, just surprise me
A lot of niggas hating, I'm just now realizing
Your girl legs I will be dividing
Her pussy be open, my dick just be hiding
We just on the coasters, my niggas be riding
Everywhere I'm going, girls be so excited
I went to your showing, no hoes got invited
Come put out the beat, that shit got ignited
My vodka's from Poland, I'm not the politest
I might grab your ass, I know you finn' to like it
I told you I can't drive bitch, police done took my license
So I be Just...

And they all wanna feed my ego
When they wanna lay up in the front seat do'
With the feet up, 'Beep Beep' in the Regal
Baby hurry up, 'Skeet Skeet' she go deep throat
Then I'm rolling in the wind, Chi Town
Top down in the summer time, brand new number 9's
I be lovin' that crap like it's Cee-Lo
They be lovin' my crack man I'm Nino
She know that I see more C notes than you
Give me Chemo, home sick and I need help
But I hardly medicate myself, I doctor everything that I do
I've been the one, since I was one
This game I got, it weighs a ton
These bitches go, these bitches come
She scream some more every time she cum
Orgasms and a lot of Champagne
Back spasms and diamond rings
Diamond cut, nigga it's no cut
When I yell "HiiiPower, TDE Gang"
I'm ridin' round, I'm ridin' round
The corner from success, and I made a left
Then I got it right, now fuck your life bitch Kendrick's next
I'm talkin' dick in the whole world
Your Ex and your new girl
Shit you nothin' new girl
There's better bitches than you girl
As I ride around, I'm right around the corner from success
Then I made a left and got it right
Now fuck your life, my dick is wet. Pause
[Casey Veggies talking]
Hold up man this my song, let me take it back real quick for ya'll

[Verse 5: Casey Veggies]
It's young Veggies
I prefer to just get the dome
Little niggas was at home
I was grindin' 4 years on my own
Don't act like you can't see a nigga
In your past life you can't be a nigga
You can have an approach, make a lot of money
In the end you still gonna be a nigga
To the government, my covenant
Got attitude no Eazy-E
Po po's ain't seeing me
Four shows and I need some tea
Young and going through puberty
But in high school man I made the G's
My legal grind gon' take me far
I'm a porcupine I'll stab a heart
I shine hard off my heart
Gimme me the light like Sean Paul
She'll drop it low for this young nigga
Girl you should be askin' to run with us
Baby girl I'm just one nigga
I can only chill and have fun with ya
Big dreams make big figures
I'll wrap the city like big tigger
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
Going down and I'm livin'
In life you always get a choice
And I chose the right at that wisdom
Gone

[Hook 2x]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico

[Outro: Casey Veggies]
Ah, the swagger
Dollar after dollar
Keep a bad chick with me
And I always pop my collar
If she ever got a problem
Get rid of her ass to solve it
Smash her at night
Then I kick her out in the morning

She in My Car Lyrics[Intro/Outro: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, life rhymes
That’s all I know, that’s all I do

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yo, I got some problems that you can’t relate
I got some condos that be out of state
We got Serato at the spot, though
And we party with some bottles, go full throttle, that’s the motto
If I pull up, she gon’ follow, used to hit, all them potholes
Picked up the tour van in Chicago now we pullin’ up in drop Rolls
She passin’ out, I be revivin’ hoes
I gotta sit down, we passin’ out at the Bellagio
She hand it to me like I order that
She hand it to me, I’m up the middle, she my quarterback
Been hittin’ sit ups, runnin’ laps, tryna get my core intact
‘Cause I look around, and my elders teach me time’ll pass
‘Cause it’s been fast since the last time I got a hall pass
Said I was goin’ to the bathroom, but really, I just wanted to swag
Lunch time, everything fine, when the bell ring we’ll be doing the day
Either we gon’ make a dollar or we gon’ try to make away
[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
This my shit - that shit sound hard
After my show – she in my car
Started a hustle - now we stars
We hit the strip, she in my car, she in my car, she in my car
She in my car, she in my car, she in my car
She in my car, she in my car, her problems solved
Said this my shit - that shit sound hard
Started a hustle – and now we stars
And now we stars

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
So bring it to me like I ordered that
I’m downtown in my corner flat
Yeah – screamin’ “other people’s money, nigga”
So right now I don’t wanna rap
‘Cause I’m that nigga you don’t wanna jack
Yeah – she leave me, I don’t want her back
I got hoes, I don’t want her back
I got hoes, I don’t want her back
So shout out to Veggies
I’m not doin’ no feature for no nigga except me
My mom she love Pepsi, but me, I drink Beck’s, see?
Times are real hard, but the Lord he protects me
My niggas gon’ rep me, bitches gon’ text me
I’m fuckin’ with Lexi, on weekends especially
Write ‘til my hand hurt and then I go lefty
You want it? Come test me
And you’ll end up resting

Back for Another One Lyrics[Intro: Casey Veggies]
The moment you've all been waiting for

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Uh, say hello to the great one
Mixtapes for free homie, here take one
It might come in handy
A record deal was the best thing y'all can hand me
My squad, the new Grammy family
Uh, but they ain't feelin' it, oh well, more bars, I'm spillin' it
Every time I touch a mic they be like yo, your touch is tight
Y'all's focus I took slow shots, bash so hard and slow
Just like a robot, you not hot man
I'm sorry for the truth, Customized Greatly, killin' shit
Casey feels sorry in the booth, uh
Flow's so sweet they put fillings in my tooth, yeah
Fillings in my teeth, Ace the Creator on the beat
Casey Veggies on the vocals got you niggas in a chokehold, uh oh
Yeah, yeah, he's at it again, spread the word tell your moms and your friend
Yeah, because I'm
[Chorus]
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
The difference between me and them rappers
Is I wear clothes fresh out the wrapper
Undivided attention, the show's on
And no cancelled shit, it must go on
Nigga, volume two, uh, turn up the volume, too
I'm crazy lyrically, come get at me seriously
Niggas know I kill 'em mentally and spiritually
I hope you're hearin' me, uh
First mixtape was hot, I hope you fear me
Believe that, y'all niggas didn't believe that he rap
And now y'all bob your heads to the things that he rap
Uh, y'all niggas didn't believe that he rap and
Now y'all bob your heads to the things that he rap
This nigga hated and she clap, no handshakes leave daps

[Chorus]
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)

But, I'm super steezy like my last beat
My bitch super greezy like her lunch be granola bars
I spill healthy verses, call 'em granola bars
Now every bitch wanna eat her Casey Veggies with no salt
Now it's so crazy, other people than my moms is callin' me baby
My nigga get ya hopes down, you couldn't persuade me
To collaborate with you niggas, ya lyrics is lazy
I'm undefeated, but the suede shoes is Puma
I'm the cancer and the tumor with the drums and the tubas blastin'
I'm a crook and it's a castle
If I am the shit, then I'm guessin' my mom's a asshole (because I'm)

These Days Lyrics[Hook]
You know I’ll always give you my heart
Till it can’t beat
And we gon' let these days go by
Do everything that I think
Send better thoughts to me
And we gon' let these days go by
Even though we get signs
That it ain’t ya right time
We gon' let these days go by
Something bout the design
How it can take what I love
But we gon' let these days go by
[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
As long as my fam straight
Everything feel ok
My favorite rapper Kanye, she told me her’s the same thing
Now you’re doing your thing Casey and the shit you drop is Bombay
You got a chance to be the next star
As a testament that life change
Writing on my life seems, got me attention like the ice brings
Creepin on them tight jeans, ain’t trippin on gas prices
When you gonn invite me? I got a whip, you got a jacuzzi
That’s enough spoony, show me what you gonn do to me
Don’t know what to do with my damn self
So I can’t tell you where you should be
Rockin all this jewelry, minorities say it’s foolery
My gold chain and my gold ring, earrings a few k
4 ring on my 2 door, like what I worried bout you for?
Letting go of the old shit, on the better things should do more
Like flying out to Singapore, writing poetry by the sea shore
Young Veggies, fonz ready
Young veggies, I say it again
Make more, we lay low, like where ahead did the days go?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I know it’s hard not to let life’s pleasure distract you
Believe some of what you hear, cause that’s what it’s factual
This is me, got the second mixtape tattooed
On my leg, cause I stand for every word I said
She bad and she fly, she got turbulence
That mean we go to war with no alternatives
I see it in and out and I ain’t even learned of it
I did no book research and a presentation, aced the shit
The fans choosin up cause this shit’s straight legit
Like when you find a girl then start finding out her favorite things
Then you realize we got something, this can be a team
Then you move on of doing good and doing wrong
This time apart ain't doing me no type of favors
Why am I letting this do to me, I’ll see you later
This life’s a blessin, no stressing
No assault what it’s meant to be
I can be somewhere homeless
Overcoming the injuries
I can be where the home is
Where we really is from
Where the black children hungry and the water don’t come
And our money is scarce so the planes don’t fly
And they don’t make it to the us
Where they probably could fly
I never thought that one day I would look in your eyes
And see, everything that I really need in my life
Remember walking in, when my G'ma died
Crying, thinking that she could have just stayed alive
For one more moment so, I can just come say hi
Leona Smith, that’s my angel girl, you saved my life
Get it, got it good, baby girl you changed my life
Showed me the qualities that I thought was right

Whip It Lyrics[Verse 1]
The way it stack like when in pain cause I can’t believe it
I be stunting in the hood like it ain’t no secret
Pull up two door up in Compton and I’m bumpin Jeezy
And my girl hop in the car then she turn on CV
Plus these rap niggas be straight rhyming reason
I be swaggin my shit hotter than Top Ramen even
Out in Houston, yeah, and that’s just for the weekend
All my niggas waking up, like we hitting dreams then
Niggas sippin lean, Japanese ripped up jeans
While your wife she flipped the team
That’s why my main chick a queen
I put on for my city, she put on tight jeans
And then show her ass, and it’s everythin what it seems
My cousin rock a ring, sock you in your spleen
Gotta keep your heart strong, through all these broken dreams
I rock these chains in my soul really made me bling
At the El Rey, sold out, and I’m only 18
My life swisher mean went, on a different scene
Copped my mama Tiffany’s God singing symphonies
Cape on, chest out, feelin like Hercules
At the mall, going hard, making purchases
I went up, I came down off adversity
Baby girl never went to no university
She was droppin it of that spot, doing it all for that gwap
Hope her heart make it stop, take a shot for
Had dreams of the crib, suicide doors
I’m a dog for the money on all fours
Didn’t want to ride Honda or no Accords
Baby girl bad and she call me lord
[Hook x2]
Whip it, put it in a pot, then you make it stir
Baby need a job and I got that work
She was actin shy so I went in first
How she get this fly, I invented her

[Verse 2]
My fans want sequels, my clan run equal
Girl I wish I can redo every time I gotta leave you
Livin lethal, dodgin evil when I’m steady flexin
Sending signs to the sky, hope he get the message
What do you do when your first rhymes get old
Your mind get grown and it’s time to get on
Only make songs with the vibe that hit home
I put rims on my flaws and I tint my wrongs
She told me, she told me she can’t leave she already gone
I can quit right now, I’m already on
That’s how high right now I got this shit on lock down
Like murder eight counts, you ain’t never gon get out
Nah, this where they never gonn be proud
But at least I gave my all, and I made my mama smile
Passin the heavy flow, grabs with a steady growth
Yeah girl I want your heart, ass and your schedule

Garden Lyrics[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Aw man
Damn
Right back at 'em
Way better
Volume 3

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Way more smarter than my last tape
I get way more harder when that ass shake
With my shit in that, I get in that
With the thought in my head like I hope it lasts
Real young boy that's making cash
I'm realizing I can make it stack
For a rainy day when it ain't coming back
We young niggas, we fresh swag
Got the whole world in the bag
Roof in the grass now his speakers on blast
Oh shit, made it to the news stands
As I grind hard in these new jeans
I never ever stop from where the weather really hot
Where the homie ran the streets and that's why he got shot
Used to bang on my nigga, that's why he hit the block
That's some peer pressure for your ass
Girl, tell me how I can destroy your past
You growing up, didn't know no better
And I'm blowing up, my show got better
When you create some shine you know what's next up
Streets start talking, name getting brought up
Hop on now cause this train ain't stopping
Used to try my hardest, still wanna be an artist
Never was a rapper, didn't wanna be trapped in
At school, no work, just a black pen
Composition pad where the kid wrote raps in
That's where I got sleeping in class
Never really dozed off but we dream so fast
I'm leaving my past, let it stay in my dome
At the hotel I just stay in my room
Stuck in my zone, answer my phone
Said I'mma catch my flight and I'm coming back home
[Hook]
Please don't let me go
I just wanna know
Told you not to leave
And I promised we would grow
Life is like a garden
You'll end where you started
Remind me of that feeling
When I wake up in the morning
Gotta let it go

[Verse Two: Casey Veggies]
Take you out to eat, bring out the freak
Can't tell you everything that it's 'bout to be
She know a young nigga stunting
Only dumb niggas fronting
Never run from the money
Give you a run for your money
Customized Greatly, same young Casey
4-number pin and I'm about to cop everything
She enjoy wins and the thrills that life brings
She go to school and church, that's wifey
Young Veggies, Young Veggies
This Young what? I'll say it again
You would fall in love if you gave me a chance
Trying to make me a man but I already am
Love of the game, don't put trust in the fame
Full of wack ass lames throwing salt in your name
That was just to let you know
Watch what you get into
Cause these fucking streets ain't what it's cracked up to be
Hate in my heart
Never been scared
Got another thing coming if you match up with me
On my way to stardom
Never was about problems
So my cuzzo going to handle that action for free
I shaded up and I got better
New whip, I dropped cheddar
In that new joint, I'm gon' met her
And I just ignore 'em, my phone ringing like…

[Verse Three: Casey Veggies]
Let it go then let me know
If you find out what your mind 'bout
Ain't nothing better than a brand new mindset
Plus a Rolex and spot to spend time at
Find that when you figure where your grind at
I speak about it a lot because I'm 'bout that
In the back getting checks, she wasn't out there
Boy, I need your respect, I swear we don't care
We don't come at your neck, we get the whole spread
Break it down into specs and send it whole sale
Got cash in my pocket at the hotel
Having fun living life like oh well
She got the arc in the back
So I know it ain't flat
Girl show me where it's at
So I can go on and attack
She inspire me
High off life, man
A hit of that irony worth a whole lifespan
Real young black nigga from the hood
Getting money from the white man
And my girl light skin
Lot of rappers say "all the people used to doubt me"
But my whole city been holding me down proudly
Might catch C.V. chilling out in Maui
Bottle of Moscato and me and my girl 'bout it
Whole world yours
Learned that on Illmatic
Swear I been had it
Just had to grab it
I'm a sinner
And I know it
But God made me feel so heroic
Niggas be talking
Never even show it
Got something to say?
Feel free
I'm open
Roll with my music
Taught a lot of niggas how to move quick
Since I made my mind up I'mma do it back in '06
Shout out to my niggas that ain't no longer here
That don't mean them dudes died
They just no longer here
Got to learn to do it for yourself
And no longer fear
All that negative shit that people throw in your ear
If I'mma do it I'mma be great
Just tell me if you relate
You punchline-ass rappers represent the shit that we hate
Cause everything I spit helped me cop new Prada
Got new flows and I got new money
Young'n on his shit
And my brother need a whip
And he had half of his
Here go $2200
Bro I got you

Everything Wavy Lyrics[Intro]
Pulled up stuntin' man, everything wavy
Whip half a hunnid, jeans cost $580
I can tell she want it, cause she actin' so complacent
You can say I'm wrong, well I guess the boy crazy

[Verse 1]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', man that's all a nigga sayin'
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, man that's all I'm really paid in
Lifestyle flows, yeah that's all I'm really sprayin'
She called me on the weekend and we head straight to the deep end
We been, ballin' so hard from the mornin' to the evenin'
And I make her do the cleanin', then I make that girl sleep in
Turn me up, one time. I ain't got no punchlines
Lil mama so fine, so I had to give her that punchline
Like wait, hol' up. All I do is show up
She sweet like some fruit roll ups, so all I do is go up
Like wait, hol' up. They let the boy get his dough up
My girl watched me grow up, right before her eyes I blow up
They came thru makin' that noise, like that boy went in for sure
Gettin' money on tour, I might bring back velour
Suicide my doors. I'm flyin' out, you tryin' out
Got diamonds and designer, but come find out what my mind 'bout
[Hook]
Pulled up stuntin' man, everything wavy
Whip half a hunnid, jeans cost $580
Girls in the crowd, and they all screamin' "Casey!"
You know you my baby, you knew I would make it

[Verse 2]
It amazes, like where the days went
In amazment. I'm chasin', stupid commas
It ain't no stoppin' us. Period
She so furious, cause I dropped her
I'm in this ho, get some mo' though
Mo' niggas is watchin, I got this
You get knocked off, wit' the lights out
And the top off. On the block wit' Rottweilers
That boy so cold, but I'm not soft
I'm poppin' now, she used to play me off so I knocked her down
All the way to the ground, and after that she ain't make a sound
Like wait, hol' up. Tell somebody to roll up
I from killer Cali where, all we do is grow up
Like wait, hol' up. Baby girl come over
All we do is get older, so let's get it in for it's over
When I swerve up, she get piped down
I get paid off of my lifestyle
All the real niggas say, "Ayee!", all the bad girls say, "Oww!"
Everyday is payday, and every night I get wiped down
Everything been crazy and I pulled up and it's wavy

Swag, swag, swag, what's really wavy, man?
It's Josh Peas, ain't shit funny

Been shittin' on you niggas since '06, they know, they know

And appreciate this real nigga shit, Peas and Carrots, Carrots and Veggies (Yeah)

New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico
[Verse 1]
Young on my fly shit, fresher than a peacoat
Grew up nice, so when I sit back and write
I touch my life and every single thing I think of at night
Mind was in the dark, had to reach to switch on the lights
Diggin' deeper, tryna figure whats right
Shit be cuttin' like knifes, but I just try to numb it with life
I'm, ridin' roun town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
It's a lot of things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Spread out bigger, got my people on the East Coast
Cook it up, for the bucks, what you tryna be for?
Model for the kids, man, that's why I keep my sneaks low

[Hook]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo

All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico

[Verse 2]
I'm a cocky young nigga, but I know when to cut it out
Your girl amused by me, when she talk, she got stutter-mouth
Ridin' roun town, mo' change, mo' steelo
Never been to NY, but I'm 'bout to pay the fee though
Then hit ATL, rockin' sales far as we know
Press play grind, no TiVo, that's the G code
Kickin' it with friends will get yo ass no ends
And she gone regret I pass, when I pull up in a Benz
I'm just wiping off my lens, I don't see these niggas
Made a promise to myself, "I won't be these niggas"
Girl, you don't know if I hit it, you ain't seen me wit her
Young boy, so cold, I'll let you see me get her
These girls see me on MTV, nigga
Throw it at me, went ahead and caught the TD with her
It’s all about what you earn not what the feebies get ya
Don't say LA without CV in it, feel it?

Me and the homies be shaded up, with yo girl out of sight
Made a right on Hill St., comin' off La Cieniga
My girl ridin' with me, like she my manager
Like she got plans for us, but I just got plans to bust
Niggas think I'm runnin' out, but I stay gassed up
Blew my shit up, from the ground like NASA

This for all the girls, ambitious, Louis-bagged up
Pray it all go down, happily ever after

Life$tyle Lyrics[Verse 1]
Always chasin' money I think Nike should have paid me
No this shit ain't funny been with Josh Peas lately
Japanese denim still growing still winning
Baby girl want me and she watch me cause she on me
I be popping but I'm lowkey, chillin, choppin with my OG
Got my mom a new spot and I'm plotting on gold rollies
Just did a show in DC and we had them really going
If it wasn't my song all around the world then I wasn't really knowing
She messin' with the whole squad she ain't hoein' she's just goin'
I'm just knowin' that's just me
All the time that's just how it be
In the town and through the streets
Rollin' round it's Young CV
It's goin' up, it's goin' down
That mean the same thing, got a different sound
Got a different vibe, don't blow my high
I should change, I won't realize that
Another mindset other than mine I can't provide that
I soul search, write cold raps
Besides that little mama you should slide through
[Hook]
Get piped down baby
It's nice out lately
Ask me who employed this might sound crazy
Lookin' straight faced said "The lifestyle paid me
Anything else I wouldn't have patience"
Pipe down baby
Lifestyle crazy
Lifestyle paid me
Lifestyle made me
Lifestyle stages never gonna fade me
Said she tryna' roll but where you wanna take me

[Verse 2]
Been around the globe, a million different places
Peas and Carrots tee, sneakers to the pavement
Kill em with the swag and leavin' all the traces
Ride my own waves, don't participate in races
Casey why you sag if you got a Fendi belt?
You callin' out what's wrong, you should be lookin' at yourself
I'm lookin' at the game, it seem it needs some help
They callin' out my name, I'm callin' out my worth
Reluctantly, I don't think she'll ever get enough of me
Or what's left of me, maybe I just had a mental telepathy
Got the best of me, you know how it goes when you're dealing with the extra things
That come with the cars, and the clothes, and the friends that all the money brings
It's the lifestyle, oh nice wow growing up quite fast
Just slow it down we might crash
At least we made some nice cash
Comping off emotions like the roses through the ocean
And she wet got that potent and she open so I told her

Love = Hate, Ulterior Motives Lyrics[Part 1: Love = Hate, Produced by: T.H.C.]

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, yeah, I know a lot of girls that be on the same things
All my niggas in the streets smoking, trying to maintain
She like sipping champagne, I beat it out her main frame
My chick part of my campaign
And your chick looking like Flavor Flav
Hit that picture, fade away, and fall back, I’m all that
NY to LA, but a CV on my ball cap
I be around the globe, we’re going out, seing open toes
Sort dresses, them nights wrest and my fortress getting fine chick
Get anointed, get knighted, I’m addicted to fly shit
I’m a witness to righteous, steps finding out what my life is
I got a quite range, at 18, my life change
I got room keys and new things that we can do for this night thing like
[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
In the club, at the party, everybody wanna be somebody
In a world that’s so strange real niggas trying to maintain
Love and hate is the same thing, love and hate is the same thing!
In the club, at the party, everybody wanna be somebody!

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I know a lot of things, most of which I’m gonna change
That come just from growing up
Learn that love and hate is the same thing!
I can only wife the plane jane
Make a bad ho give me bad brains
I realize I had brains and I got it all, man and I gotta fall
I gave it up, man I gotta live
Girl, tell me what the problem is!
Everything is so cool and one thing we couldn’t do
One thing we couldn’t see, who real, I can’t tell
Out the drop is gonna sell, I caught it out, starting out
Young niggas run everything, make her earn that wedding ring
Then I make her sing them high notes, I got high hopes
And my side along, I love you when she ride long
That’s my angel, she always wear a halo
Ever since I got dough, my cousin told me lay low!
I can stay long, what did I say wrong?
What happened between me and you? Why we can’t even get along?
Watch me you call! You can’t blame it on me
Love and hate is the same thing
Love and hate is the same thing

[Part 2: Ulterior Motives, Produced by: Rahki]

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
She wanna leave and don’t know who wrong about it
So confusing I can’t even write songs about it
Thinking of reasons, shouldn’t feel so alone about it
Now I’m playing catch up, squeezing the wrong about it
I’m from where cops come, (sirens), gone we out it
Know when I hit the shows, ladies ain’t swarm around me
And when I leave I know the one who’ll go mourn about me
G5 thoughts, homey my mind is clouded
Today I bought a fit that was in the thousands
And a chain cold like the ice in the mountains
I started spittin, never contemplated bout an outcome
Now I’m getting more income than my outcome
My last flow was outgunned, my last girl was not one
My last homey got sun, me and my brother like one
And I’m only 19, the saga just begun
Young kids run everything under the sun
People live life very relentless
My niggas act so hard with them scary agendas
My friend claim sets pray he ain’t never get injured
Tell my homeys baby steps, hope you never befriend this
‘Cause if I’d lose who I started then why should I end it?
No, I’m kidding, I had to keep rewarding my millions
Stunt a little, cop a whip and take care of children
Spread love give thanks, just like the pilgrims
[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
It’s just another day in the life of a young nigga with ulterior motives
I wonder if I can control this
Ulterior, ulterior… motives
Ulterior, ulterior… motives, motives

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I wanna live the same life, that charm about me
Regular times, skidrows and the campus crowded
Less pressure, less things and my mind is skowin
Better relationships, we only spend time when I’m out here
It’s what I chose so I guess I can’t say that it’s not fair
Like a mom in the crack house, doing the rocks there
Put me in so deep, that’s heavy one dome kip
I pull you one of them seats and I might pull on yo hair
And when we on the east coast you know I got the cab fare
And when I’m so far away I still see and love that
Eyes blood-shut red, I’m in over my head
Act like she ain’t know I pop your head, those are my bread
That’s just what I think, fuckin that’s what I said
Then I made one blink and she was leavin me here
Told my mama I’mma make it, she was believing me yeah
But a couple year later, she didn't conseive I'd be here
In New York on my own at the regency theater
Illest kids in America, she ain’t innocent mama
And she listen to Erica, homey my girl is scholar
Your girl is sort of a wallet, we using it til that we done with
Tell her give me my money, I’m bout the 50’s and 100’s
And the conspiracy subjects are my priorities
You should give some of these
I’m on my knees and I’m begging God please
Humble my steez, I swear my whip is a tease

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
It’s just another day in the life of a young nigga with ulterior motives
I wonder if I can control this

Life Rhymes Lyrics[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
It's that young nigga, that
Always spit them life rhymes
Always slept with the right dreams
I evolve in the night time
Baby give me them pipe dreams
Wash it down with some white wine
Don't be thinking that I drink
One shot and I feel fine
Only fuckin' with bright queens
I done made up my mind if you focus on right things
And realize that it take time
You will have a great time, everything go intertwine
That's what they told me mixed with how they show me
Plus what I'm already knowin, let's get this money!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus: Casey Veggies & Jhene Aiko]
Yeah, I got all the shit in motion

I've got time for you
I've got thirty thousand on me
Might run to the whole crew

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
The concentration this shit that's basic
And niggas hating is the same reason we ain't faded!
Could have lift the nation
I know girls that's in love with racing
Can't stand to be patient
And she need her friend approval just for her to mess with Casey
He a rapper girl, that nigga crazy
But you contradict yourself tryna down a nigga caking
Talking about this boy came in and paved it
For himself and his fam man, that's some great arrangements
I wouldn't call me famous
Just a kid that's gonna change shit
When I walk in this world, I thought I ought to make it!
Keep customer service, never automate it
Please don't worry, you know I got some plans
When that school bell ring my next grind start up
Hoes wanted sex when them checks got brought up
Girls complex, swear I don't even judge her
Tell me who is next, when the best grind is all us
Have you ever felt that like it worth it?

The lifestyles of the young and wild

Swear he's trying to tell me something now!
But I'm rocking, no stopping, my best girl in Compton
My ex girl never got me, my dream car, Bugatti
But I settle for Audi, my camera is a paparazzi
My checks read young veggies, my dad read young king's
The way I love her like Amerie
Cause it's one thing,
I really think she should stay with me
Cause young girl dreams
Shout-out my G'ma
Cause she made me a young believer
This day is beautiful
They respect us, play Aretha
I told my momma, I'mma take her where palm trees at
And buy her houses with dish washers and laundry mats
On tour no time to do chores, three months on my course
Stacking dollars for sure way better than before
I think that's just what life's about
Trying to figure it out
Finding new things to add, and hope that it all amount1Embed

RIP Lyrics[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Take a drink, take a toke, young niggas ain't got no hope
Or maybe it's deep inside but they just too blinded to know
R.I.P. my nigga ghost
Livin through that Live & Grow
Grew up on Centinela & Beach, yeah right there by that corner store
Right there where them niggas post, drug dealin and blowin drow
Po-Po come we gotta go, we no-no talk to five-o
But as a young black male dude tryna dodge a cell
But I'm always followed by them cops lights
They got me livin' in a cell, tryna put me in a box
But I'm bout to break out this shit is not right
My nigga Tyler told me now we in the spotlight
The time is now and nigga tell em what your life like

It's great, I'm just bein' honest
And the green is coming like I’m mowing the lawn
And fuck the censors little nigga you should run up some commas
Your numbers don't add up, boy, you want greatness
Dr. Right now, mothafucka we hate patients
Now put your hands up like them niggas that didn't make it

I can't deal with the fact that you gone
Momma cryin family stayin strong

Momma cryin family stayin strong

Take My Life Lyrics[Intro]
Take take my life
Oh give my love babe
Gonna take take take my life
Oh, give me my love babe

[Hook]
They can take my life, take my heights
Take the name for what is worth
Just so I can have what I need
To reside on this earth
Take the gold, take the shows
Take the money and the foreign clothes
As I finish this sentence, I can feel this in my soul
[Verse 1]
Hallelujah I made it. Give viewers and alternaters a view in love for music, I can do it I’m taking it to the place that X would
Where black people dress good
And all colors love each other and my girl sex good
She makes sure I wear rubber, partially scared of loving
She often be tearing up, things get so mysterious
It’s hard to sign the right deal when all of these labels want us
It’s hard to find which one real
When all of these girls love us
Uh, I let you do your thing ’cause you so head strong
Bread long my mind gone, on the flight, 3 different time zone
When I’m right here ’cause my grind strong
And you more like some styrofoam
Wasn’t on the shit that I was on
When you was 13 I was rehearsing and flirting with my dream
Then we started dating, wasn’t right I stay patient
Now we in paradise lucky pair of dice
My life is insane, so rockin’ champagne
Cutting off my last hoes and give you my last name
Getting on my fine sway, we just wanna party
She just move her body to everyone look her way
I want it all, is my living D so front that, I’m coming back
She got the type of ass I had fun with that, had to run it back

For your legs up and don’t let me down
So affection it, so affect me now
It’s evident that I’m ready now
Word, by the time I got to think about my old dough
I was on to the next getting more dough
Coresing the vibe, flexin the thighs
That sort of time and I’m enjoying the ride
Don’t know my life, doing what’s right
The amenities, my enigma reads in December
I’m on summer shit, hot boy but I’m so cold
The next up that’s not you
Don’t rush in places when you need to take your time
Take your time patience rush
Choosing to rush, so I told you baby take your time
’cause I know we can live it up

I Love Me Some You Lyrics[Produced by Harry Fraud]

[Hook]
I love me some you (say it one more time)
I love me some you
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)

[Verse 1]
I love me some you, I be riding coupe
I be rapping my life, show you how I do
I just keep around, I need something true
Is she really rockin’, guess I never knew
Or I never know, till we live and grow
Tried to ..my chain, but if you see I through
She say I’m a rebel, I’m just on my level
You deserve a medal, I just want you to feel special
I love me some you, this ain’t nothing new
Guess I shouldn't work, I know we'll be cool
I don't never talk, she don’t never tell
I don’t never listen, she don’t never hear
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I love me some you, but trust at least a few
If I would go to school, I can be with you
You know I’ve been playing, I like joking too
How far can it go? I’ll always let it show
Sometimes we try too hard, I should just let it go
You wanna go for what, just let me open up
My thoughts be bottled in, I need to cough it up
Panamanian girl, with you eyes to the world
Yeah you’re so precious, I shouldn’t be so reckless
When dealing with your heart, should handle that we care
Ain’t like them regular ballers and girl I’m doing something new
They always got something to say, when you doin you

[Bridge]
What I tell you shouldn’t make you different
You should respect the fact that I made it livin’ yeah
What I tell you shouldn’t make you different
In the first place I already made you feel me

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I love me some you, just keep me in the loop
Even if it hurtin’ just tell me the truth
Had to take a pause just like an interlude
Then get you in the nude, this what I dream to do
Yeah you so precious and that ain't no extras
I like your whole text, just a young boy and my fam from Texas
Where we could go when we get old
And our kids can know, I love me some you

Young Winners Lyrics[Intro]
What’s your story?
Where did you come from?
Where you get that from? You know what I’m sayin’?
Young winners, big dreams
Let’s go

[Verse 1]
I’m poppin’, we on
She playin’ my songs
I prefer to just get the dome
Or the backside ‘cause I like that position
Real young boy with a king intuition
Hard like a nigga in prison
??
Ride through the city with a sassy young thing and she part of the committee
Girl let’s get down to the nitty gritty
If you ain’t wanna flirt then cover your titties
Says she wanna boss, want someone like Diddy
Ain’t making a band
Just made a hundred grand
Young winners we got it, man you born not needy just like me
Baby so cold, baby so cold
Make me wanna tap her on the shoulder, tell her let’s roll
To a place where we know we can go
Remember when they didn’t even know we can flow?
I’m the freshest young kid, most popular
Catch me in the city, I’m popping up
Ain’t no such thing as a pop of blow
‘Cause you still gon’ forget what you used to know
I’m putting on, I’m opening doors
I’m loving my high, touching my lows
Girl where you wanna get dropped off?
We can drive this time with the top off
How ‘bout this time I get topped off?
Excuse my language, that’s just Spanglish
We just had a boy talk ‘cause he famous
Getting to wild, gotta tame it
Saw a strange sight, I should frame it
Just to let you know, we ain’t on the same shit
[Hook]
I’m poppin’, we on
She playin’ my songs
I’m rightin’ my wrongs
It took me so long
I came a far way and I did everything my way
That’s progress, my options
That took time to process
(Young winners, we got it
Young winners, we got it, man) (x4)

[Verse 2]
If you don’t compromise then you gon’ strike
Are you ride or die?
Please don’t lie
See on to the next with it, didn’t realize that she had the best with her
S on my chest, I’m Superman
Flying through the hood
Told the homie what’s good
Thought you need a lil' bit of inspiration
So I told myself I might as well should
Said I might as well should
Yeah, I might as well should
I’m that dude
I wear my heart like a tattoo
My life is art
My nights are long and my rights are strong
Gotta live a little to write this song
Gotta focus to be what I’m on
Gotta booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Young winners, we got it
Shaded off in the tropics
Talk to the people like a prophet
Hope my youngins ain’t misguided
Make sure you the flyest
And work on your timing
Don’t be mad you ain’t shinin’
You can spend that time grindin'
Ask about him in the streets
They gon’ say a beast
Catch her right place, right time, she gon’ freak
We squaded up like we gon’ eat
Kept the same thought like you gon’ see
She yelling out that so CV
With a lot more money than my last CD
Lot of people thought that they had me beat
Til they turned this song as an MP3, like

Roses Lyrics[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Mind racing, steady chasing, what yo life like?
Riding in that new shit you'd probably try to side swipe
From the city where they call them fades on sight
Pull me over got my rights, got some girls for the night
Real niggas for life, get your grip, run that strip
Only 1% don't own our shit, get focused man
Mama from the ghetto, so she know how to settle
Told her when I get on that something that she gone have to let go
Looking in the mirror like Casey "what should you write"?
Look her right up in her eyes like you should prolly spend the night
Her legs and chest, manifest my little stress
Young boss kiddo, please don't mess with no middle man
[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Sky so blue, ride so green, money run everything, learn that for Free
They call me young C might pull up in a V
You would go out and get it if you knew what you could be
Flip that O, get that dough, it's a mental plan
Young niggas is making grands, everybody waving hands
Everybody waving hands, I said everybody waving hands

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
So inspiring, like love that expired
And them drugs they acquired to fulfill certain desires
I'm rolling till the tires off, hoping I can fight it off
Scoping through an opening, trying to take it to a better spot
I'm something like, when you come from nothing with that hustling
My chick bad, ass look like muffins out the oven
Girl, better show me something it ain't up for no discussion
And if she did it, for really, I'm still gon' hit it
Eventually, all we need, good vibes and energy
She trying to rule, but I don't give her an inch of me
Peas and carrots get money the green infantry
Rose on the beat and I rose from beneath yo

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Sky so blue, ride so green, money run everything, learn that for Free
They call me young C might pull up in a V
You would go out and get it if you knew what you could be
Flip that O, get that dough, it's a mental plan

That's on some new shit, swag so intrusive
Jabs so abusive, dreams so elusive
(and it was an illusion)

Nobody LyricsVerse 1/

Yo, them same stuck up girls gon' be ugly when they grow up
I spent four years grinding in hopes that Ima blow up
And remained humble. Get a new chain but stay with the same hustle
You say you love me but I can’t trust you. Man this game ugly
I stay high just tryna stay above it
I’m in the streets just tryna stay in touch with
Everything that I grew up with. That’s how I make my money
Young nigga's on the rise and you can’t take it from me
And I put that on me, keep my circle nice and small I gotta couple homies
That’s on my day to day. I know a lot of people but I just stay away
Cause ain’t none of them gon' get me paid
I try to talk to god I’m tryna pray, but I just don’t know what to say
In life, you just gotta find your way
Watch your back nigga and guard yo face, in hopes that one day...

[Hook]
Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, Life changes

Verse 2/
It’s so hard to keep a clear mind dealing with life’s field mines
Shit blow up once you think it’s all fine
But Ima keep on trying, like my grandma did
Been in that nursing home for ten long years
But she forever gone stay right here, that’s in my heart
I get attached to everything I start
And resort to action when it’s time to win, cause I don’t wanna end
Girl, I don’t want nothing if I can’t have it all
Not insecure, that’s just how I was taught
You moving on? That’s what I never thought
In this life I just need some love, only something true
I guess that’s why I’m tryna fuck with you. Don’t wanna be alone
Don’t wanna argue just wanna get along
Not in the mood, I don’t answer phones
Just need some time i’m tryna free my dome
Girl come over let’s get it on, and watch me never stop
To make up for all them other times...

We made it man, we did it
She playin up, I’m livin

Girl go hard and take it up
It’s the only thing that fulfill my dreams
Life been kinda hard lately
So go and get me hard baby

Don’t worry bout them critics

They don’t see how we livin
I moved out the hood
I’m cool now, we good
And I knew that I could
We made it man, we did it
I treat we like my decisions
I make it in, I break it in
Not worried, about to see it later
I’m geeked up in a discreet truck
With the Visa and a diva
She see us, we the reason
For the season, oh Jesus

Young Mufasa, we was just Odd Toddlers
Grew up pro scholars but never went to college
Should I feel abliged ‘cause I didn’t go get knowledge?
Hell nah, men I’m on it and I’m out here getting these dollars
I won two with no shame
Let you down, that’s no way
I’d choose you first any day
Never put no one above you
You got my heart, I really love you
Sacrifice it all just because you
And if I lose it all we got each other
Yea, we got each other
We made it man
I just deposited 100 bands
In the bank doing the running man
I’m the Son of Sam, I’m the youngest champ
She go so fast and guess what
All these hoes fuck, nigga shade up

Toe Tag Lyrics[Verse 1]
Holy moly oly I got goldy on my rollie
I went back and studied oldies
So I can rap for niggas boldy
I just kill it, Spur of the moment like the playoffs and Ginobili
I'm actually more like Kobe don't pay for shit, man they blow me
A bunch of people know me, I'm on, let's get it
What you saying, I'm with it, I’m referee in my city
Everybody got different paths
You cross I'm blowing my whistle
Eat that bone to the bristle
Cut a chick off use a chisel
Don't mean to break hearts, here’s some tissues
Like you can't wipe up your issues!
Bottle of Sprite to slow down!
Party all night and get lifted
I'm here the future is present
I guess that mean that you gifted
I got a team full of boppers
Plus some dreams full of wisdom
[Hook]
I’m High, When I smoke
She riding, she rollin'
We havin', A moment
I'm popping, so I'm opened!
Toe tag, body bag, kill them with the swag
Toe tag, body bag, kill them with the swag
Toe tag, body bag, kill them with the swag
Toe tag, body bag, kill them with the swag

[Verse 2]
Just one man, I got two hoes
I got three flows, and I know four more
Wait, I'm lying, I'm just jivin'
You probably gon' have to add a few fives in
Swear I got the game, no trying
Lauryn love is in Zion but my love is grinding
Killed the show then had six classes
Wait for.. rich actress that will pick me up in a seven series
Eight missed calls, I ain’t hear it
She love the way I spit my lyrics
Killed the cat, it got nine lives
Don’t like loud hoes like tie dye
Ten hoes in my high top, she thick though we wifi
That’s connect she ease my stress
I write the drug, I'm CVS
That’s gon' happen, getting easy checks
I got the dough then call the team
Read up, we re-ed up, I'm so chill, she geeked up
So meet me up in that kind of roll
We gonna need three G trucks

Backflip (Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: IamSu!]
Aye, bet the money make her do a backflip
Do it for the team, homie that's it
Use to put money in a mattress
We do it all the time, no practice
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip

Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)

[Verse 1: CASEY VEGGIES]
I bet that money make her do a backflip
A hunnid' grand, I had to do gymnastics
But I ain't got no cash up on my plastic
They tell me I'm a young legend in this rap shit
But lets get back to this whack shit
This backflip got them girls gettin' ratchet
She brought two hoes with her, that's a hat trick
I'm runnin' circles, run them hoes like a track bitch
I had to pick her up in my newest ride
The newest guy, out L.A, I stay super fly
The coupe in drive, down La Brea on the west side
She bring that pussy straight to me, that's suicide
I'm still in the hood, I did this verse in Inglewood
With a model doing things she said she never would
I live the life these other niggas wish they could
But I gotta thank God cause I'm living good

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Aye, bet the money make her do a backflip
Do it for the team, homie that's it
Use to put money in a mattress
We do it all the time, no practice
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)

Sauna Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's so irregular, younger, but so ahead of you
I put her friend on the leash same time I was petting her
I'm the type to pull up in the new coupe, spit it like a movie, nigga no spoofs
It's like I put my flow down on my notepad and my ho pad when she was opening those legs
You the type of nigga probably rock Pro-Keds
Got no swag, homie that shit so sad
I'm the illest, all hype killer, thinking something bigger like an all white dealer
She look too bad, then I might have to hit her, got girls in line, and girls on their grind

[Hook]
Oh, man, I came in this bitch with a lot more money and a lot more chips
Bad little mama, hotter than the sauna
Got on my Pradas, and I'm looking like a scholar
Oh, man, I came in this bitch with a lot more money and a lot more chips
Bad little mama, hotter than the sauna
Got on my Pradas, and I'm looking like a scholar
[Verse 2]
I'm so out of here, you should call the coast guard
Above most y'all, but I don't boast at all
Ball hard like when I was in my backyard
You slack dogs still trying to touch backboard
I don't see nobody, party with my posse
We be gettin naughty like relationships on Maury
Had a dream, now it's partial, I get money, like the stories
Like some meals on my team, big money like I'm 40
I'm like Obama when I come through the town
Do my round, let's shut this shit down
You probably never know my mind
But I'll tell you something right now, it's my time

Uh, yo, yeah, yeah, same-o, same-o

Too many girls, but, hey, it wouldn't kill me
You gotta feel me, they can't even conceal me
Can't hide me, can't keep me at the bottom
I stay cool from the top to the bottom
I'm about the green and I forgot to eat the bottoms
We faster, full throttle
I got a lotta babies, I forgot to give 'em bottles
We so customized greatly, and that's my motto
We faster, full throttle
Give 'em big deals like winnin' the damn lotto
Rollin' rims in the whip, check my auto
Gucci G's (?) man, this girl's eatin' tacos
Flow's so cold, I'm oh Domo
Now you other rappers is fuckin' so-so, like

Money is good, but it can be evil
Spell it backwards, live, keep it all cerebral

In order for you to be a rich negro
Here's a preview, Casey Veggies gon' do what he do

Baby Don’t Cry Lyrics[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Guess that love shit don't last forever
We was in love but girl, now your ass whatever
Cause at the end of the day, I need my cash and cheddar
And the Gucci sneaks to match the sweater
I used to laught whenever, but now I'm mad at always
Cause when I hit you up, you be gone all day
Like when I hit you up, I be like come play
You be like, I can't I made plans today, I'm like, damn!
I thought I was your man, I thought no matter what
That you should always understand, cause I swear
My plan ain't to get up in your pants
But you need to gimme something you wouldn't give another man
I need to feel special, just like everybody do
But it sucks you ain't around, it was always me and you
We was always trynna chill, we was always trynna do us
It was a love bomb, but that shit just blew up
I know you seen them text, but that girl never knew us
I always holla'ed at her, but never gave her too much
The thing i loved about you, you was never on me too tough
But know when I holla at you, you be acting too tough
[Hook: (?) & Casey Veggies]
Baby don't cry, I hope you your your head up
Even though the road is hard, you can't give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you your your head up
I know it ain't cool but shit will get better

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I really love how you were, just thinking 'bout your future
And trying to get your homework done, that was so super
I didn't wanna lose ya, but that don't mean I did
But we ain't talk lately and that shit kinda weird
And I know, I could get any girl I really search for
But really girl to me, it seem like you worth more
You something to work for, you made it so hard
I think that's one of the reasons you was up in my heart
I just wanted to love, I ain't want it to end
Cause I need someone to call, when I'm in need of a friend
But I guess I didn't do right, but I can't regret nothing
Cause I was just doing me and I ain't a fan of fronting
It's crazy, the sun light leave, shit get shady
And maybe, I should just leave so you could stay free
Really let go, of the part of you that made me
But if I stay gone, you will always be my baby

Loved Then Alone Lyrics[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Retro Jordans, let's go scorin'
Triple doubles on niggas like we Jordan
I'm just living life, tryna find what's important
Cause I ain't trying to grow up, can't even pay the mortgage
All I spit real, I should get rewarded
My dad told me if it ain't legit, don't record it
Yeah, yeah, Aretha Franklin bumpin'
We just want respect, if y'all don't give us nothin'
DJ Khaled, we the best in the function
So them girls start running when we come in
Yeah, this the best out, hand your little checks out
We trying to get paid, you other niggas bank checks bounced
When I was younger, I used to smile, never stressed out
But when it come to handshakes now, I'm giving less out
Fake niggas, fans taking pictures
We just want to blow, so our ex girls can miss us
Like
[Hook: SiR]
Oh, I know things gon' change
But you gotta know
That it will forever stay the same
I ain't got time, time
I'm in my zone
Loved then alone

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I'm like a Bruin when I spit it
UCLA, born and raised in it
They don't play, and homie I must say
That I am so thankful, that I ain't get pulled down that route like an ankle
All the youngin's should thank us
We making moves, I'll leave them haters in anger
Tryna do us like Jenga
Pull the block out, and hope our shit fall off
But I be on my boss shit, guess I paid all costs
I'm a star I hope you see that
Just show me where the beat at
You sleeping on the kid, you an insomniac
I never ever ever had a Range or an E-Class
But the kid now shining like a pimp on rehab
He can't stop it, I'm an identified object
That you've never seen before
That's why I got the meanest flow
If you look, I could show you things you've never seen before
Thank the lord, every time as I let the demons go
Yeah

When I look back
On all the shit I've been through, it's crazy
But look what it made me, today
They can try to slow me down, or get all in my way
But I ride the beats like home town streets and I ain't here to stay

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Have you ever been confused?
Don't know what to do?
Girl keep tripping, is it her, or is it you?
I made a little money, spent it all on some shoes
So when I step in the room, I don't got nothing to prove
Loved but alone, stay up in my zone
I swear it keep ringing, but I don't answer my phone
I used to give my all, just so you can shine
But now I'm doing me, and I ain't really got time
[Hook: SiR]
Oh, I know things gon' change
But you gotta know
That it will forever stay the same
I ain't got time, time

Damn
[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Nigga we be on our shit, call us cow manure
The young boy stay clean even in the sewer
My last girl was super but I couldn't get through to her
I swear I was literally just tryna get into her
But you can't even have her, I'm the closest thing to her
Can tell you everything about her, felt like I really knew her
But if God could bless anybody, I swear I'd just choose her
Cause she's a good girl tryna stay true to her
My mind stay racin' I swear I could run in Cuba
Been shaded up lately, blowin' hard like a Tuba
Like man am I a loser? Or is it just a new her?
I swear I'm the only dude in her life that improved her
But when I grow up man I might just have to move her
Somewhere with the money we gon' ball like a hooper
Been doin' a lot of growin' I swear I been on some new stuff
Livin' like the Jefferson's, nigga it's that time to move up

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
I'm up late night just tryna get it right
Swear I been on my grind just tryna stay outta sight
This is "Sleeping in Class" just tryna spread my light
Tryna make a mil off these little thoughts that I write, right
Forever, forever ever, forever ever, forever
In any weather I'm here whenever

We'll stay together and make it better

Every single morning, when ya'll cracking I'm yawning
From nights in the studio, nigga if ya didn't know
I'm on it, on it

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Dreamer turn believer 'bout my salad like Caesar
The society just tease us findin' ways to decrease us
My rhyme's like Jesus findin' ways to increase us
This my story, gettin' money is a thesis
Cause what my family leave is for my nephew's and my niece's
Just wanna make sure my generation don't fall to pieces
Cause what all them teachers teach us
Got degrees and they don't believe us
They lie to us when they conceive us
Tryna shred us down to pieces
That's reality

I’m The King Lyrics[Produced by Freshchuck]

[Intro Skit: Corey Jones & Casey Veggies]
Hey Casey, where you about to go?
I'm about to go to the studio, man
Man nigga, you know we got practice
Bro, I ain't going to practice today
Man you miss practice again, dad gon' fuck you up
Oh well, I'm tryna do this music, man
Shit, you tripping but fuck it bro, be safe nigga
[Interlude 1: Casey's Father]
Like any parents would, we wanted our son to have more than we did. So we pushed for him to use basketball and academics to get out the hood

[Verse 1]
Picture me on my side of town with the top down and I'm riding
AC on cause it's hot outside, got a bad one beside me
We done came up
It's been a long time coming, I'm still getting excited
Foreign whips, exotic trips, my whole family got a pot to piss
See I'm the one to put the blame on, I grew up getting my fame on
They hear me but don't see my name on it
You took my swag, shame on you
If you knew better, then lil nigga you'd do better
My mind right, my whip clean
My money match my new sweater
Who better? They slept on me, we taking this to a new level
I be over shit, I dropped her off and I got right back into the cheddar
Nigga this my city and I run it like Usain Bolt
I been on tour not the videos and I always see the same hoes
Every track I spill my pain on it, nothing been the same for me
Wake her up in the morning and I make her tat my name on it like

[Interlude 2: Casey's Father]
After a while, my little man gained a strong will and different plans. It was then that he picked up a mic. I knew about the rap game and the last thing I wanted him to do was lose focus. He didn't. Not only did he make the honor, he had several acceptance letters to colleges. And a mixtape so compelling he was buzzing everywhere. He won my respect and he was allowed to pursue his dream. Now today when I listen to his music, there is no bigger fan. I'm Big Joe, Casey's father. Watch it work

[Verse 2]
A lot on my mind, I'm trying to show ya
That's part of life, you live and you grow
She sucking me slow, making me feel I'm on top of the world and I'm letting her know
I'm a young man, shit I'm getting manners
I just get this feeling, I don't understand it
I'm high off life and she faded off me
Love is a drug and I'm bout to O.D

I can tell shit gon' change
The crazy things she would for them diamond rings
Baby girl got her own she can be my main
I wonder if she all the way so that she wanna stay
The good ones go, no I can't let her down
I can't wait for it no, I need it right now
She tryna lay me down, know she a turn around
My mind go to different places when I spend time alone
It's sounding like "la-la-la-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-la-la-la"
What's on your mind, I want you to tell me right now
Lately I been feeling down and she go down
Go down, go down
Baby do it so good, she deserve a crown
And I'm the king
(Aw man, aw man, aw man
Aw man, aw man, aw man
Aw man, yeah)

[Interlude 3: Casey's Father]
It took a long time for Casey to get here. The trials and tribulations of life. The things that turn a boy into a man. The things that made my son live and grow. I know you waited patiently for this album, I hope it was worth the wait. I hope you see his vision, I hope you see his vision

Yeah, Swag worth a million

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Rain flooded threw on my frames cause my name stuntin'
It's all gon' change cause my name coming
So fitted young niggas with mo vision
I did it all its no rush
I like chicks in low chucks that like to dance, toe touch
She love school and love to suck
Never met a girl that I could trust, except my mom and my main chick

I grew up with some wild shit, thank god my father could tame me
Or I prolly could've been a games b, But ain't none of you Niggas gon' change me
I'm the same G Young Casey not easily influenced, by my friends
Same ones that brush me off gone be the same ones tryna ride the Benz
Three months thats on tour with Mac Meezy and his White Fans
Pulled off in them groupie hoes they chasing us tryna to caravan
My flow carrion Burberry cologne she call my phone I'm in the zone
Trying to think to young to drink but if we going I'm copping Patron
The homie said he got a clothing line, told him send me that I'll rock it fasho
I'll swag you out I'm beneficial Underground and Providential
Past full of broken dreams I finally found some shit official
Momma said she proud of me can't wait to get her everything she wishing
Ride it slow, Ride it slow cause if I don't I could probably crash
At 13 used to rap my dreams, at 18 got a pocket of cash
Weight of the world, the weight of the world
Can't wait no more I'm taking the world
Praying to God and keeping it thorough and oh man I'm hoping it works
Like hoping it works said I'm hoping it works

Yeah
I'm in South Africa right now if you're wondering
I'm out here in the field
Almost done with my debut album
Hope you doing good shawty

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]

She a mix of black and anglo, going down the pipe like Drāno
Shit change when yo' chains grow
I got a girl that chase where yo' chain go
I'm off the chain like the Django
Poppin Champagne, and Rose Moet
Been two years she growing up, damn girl you got body
And I'm trying to remember the last time when I seen you last at that party
She signed up for my program and then hopped up in my Audi
We ain't really with all the titles, but she know that that's my shawty
(YEAH THAT'S MY SHAWTY)
I been busy dream chasing and recording
Let's hit the hotel and have a party
I fuck with black bottles, moet and that shawty

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Puma Life we killin' that, I rock headbands all summer
Like Weezy baby or Birdman I feel like the number one stunner
If this was like '06 I would've pulled up in that Hummer
Yellow with the windows tinted rims big like bitch get up in it
She dancing on me like Soul Train, I'm a rockstar like Coldplay
I bet that money gon' make her do it, These broke niggas get no play
Get to the dough my day job, We do it no practice like A I
If this shit was the NBA, then I'm that rookie nigga that stayed on
Life Changes, White ranges, Black beamers, and Jeep wranglers
PNC , we got our own store on Beverly, them white people hate us
Hater niggas is instigators, I guess the boy intimidate ya
Young nigga been running the city, When I was 7 I got plugs with the mayor
I fell in love and I felt played, that's how the game go
I'm grinding out in Cape Town, all around the world my name known
A lot of people gon' stay down, but when shit hit the fan then they gone
The dark always come to light, I'm just glad that it didn't take long
Girl I need that to go for that take home
These bitches love me like a Drake song
Ever since my grandma passed away, My momma showed me how to stay strong
We blowing up like Napalm, these days short and these night's long
Girl I know that I fucked up but I learned from it that's the right wrong
I beat it up with my ice on, She like "Casey, you on your rapper shit"
21 I made years in Veteran, never quit
Don't bring your girl around me like Trey Songz I take your chick
Subtweet, yeah that's my freak, I hit it twice a day all week
It's Young Veggies, you know my name, I don't like to play, but I play the game
It's levels to this shit boy, and me and you are not the same
Peas and Carrots you know the gang, Hunnit Mil that's the aim

Duckin And Dodgin Lyrics[Hook]
A young nigga getting paper
Tell me do it now, but I swear I'll do it later
Ducking and dodging, tryna stay away from fake shit
Niggas wanna hate us, but the bitches wanna date us

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I live my life like bungee ropes and backflips
And I want it all like 20 hoes at Saks fifth
Yeah, Uncle Dave made the track hit
So I beat the beat up just like I did my last chick
Rock the same sneakers, I don't remember my last switch
Still on that same shit which means I'm never past tense
Yeah, yeah, shout-out to the Chi-Town
All I ever know is keep going and never drop out
The promoters be bogus homie I need my cash now
Young Veggies and the green stand for cash cow
And watch me milk it all out
Told myself, if I get a chance, I'm going all out
The fourth quarter is open, I'm tryna ball now
I got goals, she knows, she tryna call now
She's throwing, she knows I ain't gonna stall out
We give a damn what these rap niggas talk about
I'm way younger and my style well thought out
I’m independent, you niggas think I bought out
Young nigga wylin', 30 thousand
On tour 40 miles and (?)
[Hook]

[Bridge]
She know I got dollars and I'm always on mine
I don't come 'round when she want me but I'm always on time (Whenever I come!)
Grinding and I'm knowing I'm gon' get my shine
We endin' in the front so ya'll should get in line

[Verse 2: Rocky Fresh]
It's Mr Fresh up in this bitch, now tell me can you handle it?
Put the heat on wax like a muthafuckin candlestick
Nigga lighting cannabis (hydro catch a tan of this?)
Care less about a hater, give a fuck if you a fan of it
Tell me I'm the man and shit, the truth I do without lying
A hard worker and I spit until my mouth tired
You heard I'm hostile, support to get my account higher
Or you gonna act like Robin Williams and doubt fire
I'm never tired cause I'm always on the rise
Models chick between the thighs, could you even be surprised
I'm just chilling with my guys on some high class shit
Y'all graduate from lame and get a master in disguise
That's why me and Casey winning cause we staying true to us
And these hoes be busting down every time we hit em up

Customized Greatly Intro Lyrics[Intro]
Customized Greatly
And we customized greatly
Yeah, and they customized greatly
Now everybody customized greatly
Feel good to be back man
Feel real good to be back
Imma start if off like this

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm leaving school early, I got a stack to make
This school don't teach me no swag so I guess that can wait
To chase the dream, you know how long that can take
But you better off being quiet if that's all you gon' say
Lookin' the eyes, sometimes you gotta realize
The way you feel tries to stop you from your real grind
I know niggas who would die for a real mind
But I got it so it's that "let's go make a mil" time
Life changing, rearranging, different stages
Different stages in different cities, man shit is crazy
Who would have thought I come to kill it, promoter paid me
Come back home, they run into him like "That's the same Casey!"
A grown man, them same problems don't remain to phase me
Still shining, still growing, still Customized Greatly
On the grind, they wasn't knowing now they gotta face it
Girl, you still on my mind and I ain't trying to erase it
Face my problems like its gotta be read through some pages
Speaking to God, swear I'm working on my patience
Was having a bunch of fans when you my favorite
But I got a bunch the plans, I'm running to the pavement
The streets of L.A. where I lay my pavement
Words spread so fast, a nigga out in Asia
Yea, be discreet with your wishes, you might get 'em all
The future is odd, I think it's time to kill them all
Asalaam alikum to all the flakers and the constant haters
Who constantly contradict themselves, and in person take the time to face us
To all the pretty girls who would probably take the time to date us
Attitude like a possum but her face like [?]
This the definition of customized greatly
All intertwined in these rhymes, it's all the shit that made me
Shout out to my pops kept me from going crazy
Without that don't know where I would be but swear I'm goin lately

Maybe, I Should Go LyricsYeah... One, Two, Three, Come On

[Verse 1]
Let your girl breathe and explore until the time right
I've been chasing lime light, no time to get her mind right
Yeah I got some other girls, but I just give 'em klondike
Trying out some new things, I might just hit a blonde dyke
I don't give a damn, get it in 'til the time out
I been spitting rhymes now, finally bout to shine now
My bitch Pocahontas, got no problems, got her new shoes
Then she do her thing, hands-free like a blue tooth
Young Veggies cracked a couple hoes, had a few schools
Ask about the boy in L-A, man I'm too cool
I'mma cop a Benz, Anwar gon' cop a new Coupe
Josh take this girl whip and he drop her to school
Casey, how you live? All these girls and good food
Fresh raps, got my set, cash you hate a nigga's fool (?)
I put my niggas on, don't hang with different crews
It's ridiculous that you would try to ridicule
[Hook]
I think I should go, Man I don't have to stay
I'll get out the way
Yeah, I said
I think I should go (think I should go), I don't have to stay (Man, I don't have to stay)
I'll get out the way
Yeah
(I mean, I don't wanna go. But...
I guess I got to, you making me feel like I got to
Come on)

[Verse 2]
In a deep dream dwelling off my accomplishments
I don't think she should come just cuz I'm on my shit
I feel dumb, I'm too young, just need to swallow it
But I want her so bad it's like I'm gargling
Young boy stuntin' but I'm not a star
Did a couple shows, time to cop a car
And life sometimes, we just don't know who we are
So every bar like a letter testament to God
I'm feeling odd like my future where it all start
But I'm tryna keep it moving on my own tint
I be thinking why she do this as the phone ring
But I just hang up cuz she did the same thing
Damn.... Damn, She did the same thing
But who knows, we'll see
Keep going 'til the fat lady sings, Young CV

(Man you need to stop holding shit in man
Say what you gotta say man)

[Verse 3]
Maybe I should go, just let me know
Never have to stay, I'll be right on my way
Escorted by a girl with a cute face
Early day and we headed to the matinee
When I was younger I dreamed of flying and putting time in
At time, life needs fresh creations and new design and
My logo stitched, my sneakers sick, and my jeans designer
Designated for Heaven's gates, where the sun is shining
I used to hope for a mind that was unconfined
Not smoking blunts, fucking dimes, that's a waste of time
And in the next moment, everything in my head switch
I found myself doing that same thing, like its fine
I thought for a long time on what I should write
Spent a lot of late nights making sure it's right
A whole story, yo it's true and all that you should know
Don't take it personal, but I think I should go
[Hook]
I mean, I don't wanna go (damn) but...
I guess I got to, making me feel like I got to
Come on
I had a dream... Know what I'm saying
I had a dream... that we could do whatever, whatever we wanted to do
You know, we could do whatever we thought was, was possible know what I'm saying
Follow your dreams...
Follow your motherfuckin' dreams man...
Yeah, forever in our hearts

Why Don’t We Fall In Love? Lyrics[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Casey Veggies, Ace The Creator

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm telling myself, I should go mystery C
But these niggas don't want the mystery me
Why I rap? What to defend me?
I'm like man this music shit is in me
"Yo, Casey what you doing?" Dreamchasin'
And I thank everybody that gives me motivation
If life is sneakers, guess my mind is laced in
They call me Casey Veggies man y'all can't taste him
Y'all didn't like him, but y'all wanna date him
Nigga he's too real, y'all can't fake him
Close your eyes and realize what you're gonna do to get by
Casey What you doing? I just gotta get by
So in this, I put my heart and soul
Put the pen to the paper then your heart unfolds
Open your ears, we're trynna get to you
And the Creator trynna get it too
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Base drum, High hat, intercourse with the melody
They're sailing by 4 words "Fuck You, Pay Me"
That's 4 syllables, the 3rd one is killing you
I'm half retarded so my thinking process instrumental
Yeah, look
I'm skate mental, schizophrenic, go get him
Thoughts is more raw than Supreme denim
Cause look, If fall legends die, here? I'm trynna have fun
All legends die, when I fuck my day's gonna come?
Probably next week, couple years
Dogg crip walking with a green sky the president prolly queer
Not trynna psych you, but niggas on myspace asking for beats
Get the point, I do not like you
I'm a beast with the beat but I will not hype you
Customized Greatly, don't believe? I'll pipe you
And yeah all of that while my nigga Casey Veggies was

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Started off at 12 but now I'm grounded
Heard the rhymes in the age, now they so astounded
Got phone calls home so now he grounded
My mind, my soul you can't defeat us
That's like trynna ollie without sliding your feet up
So here's the mixtape, the music re-up
Guns in his rap so he's tuff
I got a lot of verses but I don't write enough
Cause you gotta lift weights to be buff
Just shock me, y'all can't stop me
Talking to these girls man, my mind was rocky
Niggas going from Levis to Versaces
Alright though, yeah we outtyYou might also like1Embed

Hear Me Screamin’ Lyrics[Intro]
This is the stage
If you was here, you was definitely somebody
Then I was there
This is the story of a young man
Who dreams to understand
With the whole world in his hands
[Verse 1]
Workin' hard tryin' to make it to the top rhymin'
Refrigerator empty had to eat the Top Ramen
I'm in L.A. where kids rock Diamond
That's to the homie Nick, what you do is damn sick
I be on my shit them dudes need to read the pamphlet
Tryin' to get a world, more than some little dances
We be in the wood nigga, you wouldn't even go there
Was a party by the forum, I went and did a show there
I ain't tryin' to act like its nothin' to make it
Ask the girls in my city, bet they mess with us baby
I just spit it from my heart, you ain't nothin' you fake it
Yeah I said it, you dread it like your mother's Jamaican
It's Young Veggies man, swear I made a couple of payments
To be the boss, hope the haters just love what I'm sayin'
To my city, that I know'll be happy I made it
And the rap fans that ain't too sure about Casey, ya hear me screamin', uh
[Hook]
If you love me then let me see it
Stop frontin' on me behind my back, and keepin' secrets
Hear me screamin', uh
It was dark but now I'm beamin'
And I put it all in on my grind now you believe it
Hear me screamin', uh
My vision was so scenic
And I had a dedication to time, now you see me
Hear me screamin', uh
You don't even know what you do to me, truthfully
[Verse 2]
You got me mad girl that I ain't even hit it yet
But I know you miss it when I used to get you wet
You used to do me wrong and I wouldn't even get upset
Cause when you gave me brain girl I swear you passed the test, uh
Front of your friends you always tried to act
But I'm that immature kid that always had your back
We was in love, yeah girl, I thought I met my match
But you always told me what I did wrong, what's up with that?
Yo act right, say we just friends but you was kissin' on me last night
I guess you can't resist me
I'm all in your head now you tryin' not to miss me
You goin' off to college, won't be able to assist me
I bet that kid that's your best friend be tryin' to diss me
What's that lame nigga purpose?
That's the thing that always gets me
To the kind-hearted girl that so lost to my history
So confused by our love, but be runnin' to get me, you hear me screamin', uh
You might also like[Hook 2]
Know you said it, but you ain't mean it
I was lookin' at you right in your eyes, but you ain't see it
Hear me screamin, uh
We can't love if we keepin' secrets
And if what you got to give ain't real, then you can keep it
Hear me screamin', uh
You got my number, you can keep it
And if you don't understand what I'm doing, then I'm leavin'
Hear me screamin', uh
You don't even know what you do to me, truthfully

[Verse 3]
I know you love me grandma, you my star girl
You can't speak to me but I know who you are, girl
You here livin' but its not you
If I could go back in time I swear that's somethin' I'd do
You the reason that I get done what I do
You my purpose, it wouldn't be me if it was no you
You was in that nursing home before '02
When I was younger I couldn't believe it now its so true
It hurt my heart, I don't be seeing you
Be even more when I be in room 4C with you
I don't wanna see you like that, there's nothing we can do
But you been holdin' on, you so strong, I wanna be like you
I thought about you this evening too
I wanna put this whole verse through your feedin' tube
To my grandma layin' in bed, can't even eat her food
Love you so, wanna let you know that I see through you
[Outro]
Tryin' to stay, you know
Tryin' to stay up out the light, up out the spotlight
The glow
And all that kinda stuff, man
Tryna hide, tryna, you know...
It's all fake
Understand what I'm saying
This life, this game
It ain't no love in it, it don't love you back2Embed

You can’t see through naked eyez
Keep me wonderin
I feel I’d regret if I never try
She say she put me on roller coasters
To keep me round
And make me wait four years
Swear that I’d just take it down
That’s love right there
Girl can’t you see that?
I ain't wana beg
But can’t you be that
Girl that make me better
Stay down through bad weather
And let my cheddar
Act as an umbrella
Ella, baby you got it
Yo pussy tropic
It’s wet and it’s leavin spots
On my bed and
I’m really lovin yo head and
All the things you thinkin
Got my full attention
Girl I ain't even blinkin
Your ambitions got me trippin
Cuz I ain't never seen it
Most these girls only wana be filled wit semen
And be taken out wit time like you really mean it
Man, these mental reps ain't letting me stop it
You on my mind right now

I love yo get down and everything you bout
You can come round and I will dig you out
Every time

When we ridin round town
I got pianos and the strings providing the sound
This for all the wonderful queens deserving the crown
Aw Man!
Every time; we let these other people
Get in between what we doin
So we need to get that together
That’s gon make it all better
Sometimes life throw you lemons
Cuz the taste get sour
When you dealin wit women
It’s like love is one thing you can’t rewind
She was focused on one thing
I was on my grind
In life, you always gon need something true
Baby you got it, I ain't never gon leave you
To the beautiful girl
That was so stingy wit my time
That inspired my mind
Even some of my rhymes
It was one of them times
You was at home, no ride
We on the phone, all day
I ain't think bout my pride
Never met a girl make me wana put that aside
I kno it can get too late

Runnin thru my eratic mind
Is a perfect sign...

When the timing is right
I swear I love when you drop it low
And do it all night

And she tryna get sealed
After I sign my deal

Jugglin

Real life in this fantasy

Proud to know that my stance increase

Grew from the street corners wit pumpkin seeds

Told her to do the same when she on her knees
We had some odd dreams
Mixed wit Visine
Girlies wilin on me

Baby girl been poppin
Since my young teens
Had her on lock, no stoppin
That’s my young queen
I speak for the youth
Wear condoms when you knockin boots
Cuz if you a hustler wit no kids
You can afford the coupe
Girl ride wit the boy til the time out
Take a trip to where time change and
See what I’m bout1Embed

The Team Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you love her you should tell her
If you got it then sell it
Now we're poppin' it also we rockin' and I get shot and I nail it
I'm guapin' and growin' and doin' my thing got moments in tears
Got a bad mixed chick
Got a bad mixed chick, and I think we're getting married
I wanna name my son Mat... A million
She like Casey don't be worried bout it
These rappers is your children
I prepped up for the contract
Then I signed and sealed it
I put her on the team and I got it on lock
Turn my back and I won't even watch
Check him, check him get his respect up
Yeah they be hatin' and I hope God bless 'em
I'm just debating on sippin' this thing what
Dollars we making and chickens we're banging
Grinding hard and I'm staying up late
Grinding hard and I'm staying up late
You know we got the new clothing line
I can show you the catalog
Now just be ballin’ but I used to play basketball
Coach ain’t put me in the game so I had to make a way
If you see it with the fade away in LA and the temperature 88
I'm getting paid today
Fuck stress let's have sex swerve
I'mma give it to you straight swag
Give it to a girl and then and then I break fast
She ain't ever had a winner that make cash
And it's something that I happen to be just that
I ain't no hollaback
Nigga lookin' for some acknowledgements
Like the chick that go to college man
Mess with me might get a scholarship
[Hook][2X]
Hopped in my new car, spending all my old dough
My girl a movie star, she just play her role though
Came off the block, coming out on top
I put er on the team and I got it on lock
Turn my back and I won’t even watch

[Verse 2]
CV in the snow
Droppin it on slopes
Yeah they say I'm a lot of shit
But hell nah I ain't broke
Niggas losin' hope
Shouldn't even try it
She say she fuckin' with Veggie so I guess she on a diet
Yeah we poppin' that moet
Yeah my nigga G4

Go Crazy Lyrics[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Damn
Put your hands up baby
Youngin making songs
Make them girls go crazy
I do it all for the payment
Born nine-three but my girl from the 80's
I be in my Nike shit, with some fresh jeans
Young boy ballin god damn I need an ESPY
Sittin up plottin how I'm gonna make my next cheese
Chillin with my new girl thinking bout my hex fees
[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Same shit from 8th grade rocking SB's, switched up my program
Now I got more fans I ain’t never cocky, but I'm feeling like a grown man
Did my own thing tryna provide for my old man
And my momma working some now some...
I'm just tryna make a mill so she can get some sun tans
So when you holla at me only talk one thing money in my pocket man cause I don't want no friends
Got enough broking heart and niggas turned enemies that focus on everything they pretend to be
I met an actress I think she was feelin me, but she's an actress so who knows we gone see
Young CV, might catch me in a white tee, Jordans and a gold chain, Illmatic through my Dre Beats
If this was 98 I would have been on The Chronic
Youngest nigga in LA spittin that Hooked on Phonics

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I swear you living off lies, man I live off logic and I am gonna live through my bro cause he in college

That lame boy hating, I'mma put him in a sleeper
