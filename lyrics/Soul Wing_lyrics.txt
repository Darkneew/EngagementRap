SUPERNOVA! Lyrics[Intro]
Oh miss sunshine ( Repeats)

[Hook]
My heart
Shine like a SUPERNOVA!
Always in love but I've got no bae
24/7 I grind, that's all night and all day (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Even clocked in when I'm in my daydreams (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Even clocked in when I'm in
My heart, (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Shine like a SUPERNOVA!
Always in - got no bae
24/7 I grind, that's all night and all day (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Clocked in when I'm - in my dreams (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Locked in when I'm even in my dreams

[Bridge]
Coolin', coolin', coolin'
Who you foolin', foolin' (Repeats x2)

[Verse]

In my feelings
Never mind what you want, my top peeled
Ain't nobody broke my heart but I need some healing
Swimming in my emotions, five rings
Fresh out of the water, out of the Bay (uh)
Sometimes my feelings get ahead of me
I fight my demons like my enemies
I push these bars like it's a felony, don't need no melody

SoulWings shine SUPERNOVA!
Follow my heart can't do no wrong
Lost In The World like Kanye uhh
But I'm alright that's word to God I promise (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
I'm goin' break that bread and bake some commas (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
My big homie Jones he study commerce
When I get on top I'll bring the crew with
I might lose my mind to find that groovy
This beat cold as hell might win a SAMA
I'm being honest

Coolin', coolin', coolin'
Who you foolin', foolin' (Repeats x2)
Might heart I follow, all day, all night, wherever we go

[Hook]
My heart
Shine like a SUPERNOVA!
Always in love but I've got no bae
24/7 I grind, that's all night and all day (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Even clocked in when I'm in my daydreams (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Even clocked in when I'm in

My heart, (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Shine like a SUPERNOVA!
Always in - got no bae
24/7 I grind, that's all night and all day (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Clocked in when I'm - in my dreams (My heart shine like SUPERNOVA!)
Locked in when I'm even in my dreamsEmbed

SPOOK! Lyrics[Intro]

I got fears
I got fears I got
I got fears I got
I got
(Repeats)

[Verse 1]

Soulwings killing beats since a boy ah
Had to switch lanes so the feds never know ah
Two birds one boat call me Noah
I'm the new wave, I forever stay afloat, I
Don't mean to gloat, I just follow process
Soul flowing over looking like I'm possessed
I been had epitomes I gotta confess
G-O-D he told me I should serve and protect
First I was stressed, now I recognize the blessing
First I was thirst, now the water had quenched me
First I was lost had to learn a life lesson
Last will be first if you're spirit stay working
Work, work, work, get the money then you twerk it
87 Chevy that I know I've gotta purchase
97 Baby G-O-A-T and I'm lurking
Beef with the earth 'cause the cash cow murked me
Legacy I lust I know money turn to dust
Thinking of my future who I love and who I trust
'Cause the ticking hands on, my imaginary watch
Tells me time moves fast even when I'm not watching
I just want to get inside the studio and lock in
See my competition on the rise and I'm not there
And I'm not there
And I'm not there
[Hook]

I got fears
My biggest fear, I wasn't there
I'm scared to fail
I'm scared to miss the bus or hit the dust
The Fortune comes and then it goes

I got fears
My biggest fear, I wasn't there
I'm scared to fail
I'm scared to miss the bus or hit the dust
The Fortune comes and then it goes
Uh
And then it goes
Uh

{Verse]

Sometimes I wonder if they'll ever know my name
Everybody rapping too much traffic in the game
Shkrr Shkrr Shkrr
Gotta switch lanes
Hol' up, Hol' up
Build my own lane
Doggy dog world, Rottweiler, Great Dane
Reason why we make each other slaves for a chain
Reason why kids getting slain no shame
They do anything for the fame, I ain't ever gonna beg
The big homie told us build our own pyramids
We the last GOAT's if the game don't change
I'm just tryna be the change
Out of pocket for my change, I've got heaven in my name
Babekizulu, angivani nenkukhu
Anginanyo imphupo
Ngikhuluma ngoNkulunkulu everyday
Akulula kuwendlula my foes everyday
Left the city and I miss my bro's everyday
No matter the weather, sunshine or rain
I'm walking on water, I'm keeping that faith
I'm talking that gas but my tank be on "E"
I ain't got my "L's" but I'm switching the gears

No peers, SOULWINGS
Yeah yeah

No fear, no tears
No peers, oh ahhEmbed

Steps Lyrics[Intro: SoulWings]
SoulWings Real Talk

[Hook: SoulWings]
Only getting better by the day ()
They can't write you off if you're the one that's got the pen ()
I've been doing everything I'm sticking to my plan
Ay
Ay, Ay

Only getting better by the day
They can't write you off if you're the one that's got the pen
I've been doing everything I'm sticking to the plan
Ay
Ay, Ay
[Bridge: SoulWings]
One step, 2 step, carry me
Three step, four step, pray for me
Five step, six step, seven step
Take me home
Take me home
Take me

[Verse 1: SoulWings]
I woke up in summer time gardens now I'm harvesting
97 baby, born free, what the doctor said
My Momma was a Christian woman with a strong soul
Poppa taught me how to have a dream and still follow it
One step, two step
Ooh, look at me now I'm walking
I'm not politically correct
Once upon a time I tried to be a nice guy and that never worked
I can't be everything to everybody
Yeah it's something I've been trying to learn
But good tree's make good fruit
I'm the blackest berry all the way through
SoulWings, been love struck with hip-hop since 3rd grade
Trying to be the greatest rapper out, I got a clear motive
Let it be known
That C-Note look so good
But a hero don't watch that
Black Market might just upgrade S.A. outta Junk Status
This the visionary
Every single bar is paramilitary
I got sick of losing then I started winning
If I take an "L" I turn it to 7
I know my intentions bigger than attention
Everyday I gotta look up to the heavens
Cause I'm only human, just a little better
SoulWings, I'm a Soul Kid , trying to stay living
