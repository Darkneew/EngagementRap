And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going
(Is go Oíche Fhéil Eoin

(Óró mo churraichín ó)

[Verse 1]
And you said it was like fire around the brim
Burning solid, burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I drag you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

[Verse 2]
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
And of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

Take a Walk Lyrics[Verse 1]
All these kind of places
Make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone
My wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside
But off the boat they stayed a while
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so
At most I took a walk

[Chorus]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
And there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came
Just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children
Play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife
You might also likeBut then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk

[Chorus]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Honey, it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills
We had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward
To admit when I'm in need
I took a walk
[Chorus]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh30Embed

Carried Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't even note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts?
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favorite little scene
[Hook]
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about things that I said
Always let it get to my head

[Verse 2]
Oh a European, once again with feeling
Higher education making sense
Justify your thesis, certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense
Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can
And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends

[Hook]
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying

Lifted Up (1985) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me what does it take to make good now
How many years do you wait?
Oh, and now all of the clouds are combining
The flickering light's just a flame
Oh but yeah, I'm so tired
I've been away for so many years
But I guess I'll just wait a bit longer
I'll stay 'til they open the gates

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I stay here waiting
Every new year, always making me
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere
[Chorus]
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here

[Verse 2]
Oh well, how many years has it been now?
How many days went to waste?
Now the rain and the thunder are clashing
The Sun's got a smile 'cross the face
Oh, but yeah I'm so tired
I fight so hard and come back beaten
Beacon, burn through it brightly
Soared through a sliver of space

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I stay here waiting
Every new year, always making me
Feel as though there's nothing up there but

Little Secrets Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I came down the dawn poured into me
I shook em up, the walls came crumbling
My fists kept trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way I see
Everything I need
It's no way to be
[Chorus]
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
(higher, higher, higher, higher...)

[Verse 2]
My face blew up at such a casual sight
The smattered colours of ecstatic fright
The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
Oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong?
How come it takes some people so damn long?
He tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the season's stains

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole family's name

[Bridge]
Mother, I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Stabbing at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars

[Chorus]
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing

It’s Not My Fault, I’m Happy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sorry I couldn’t be there
I was tied to a rocking chair
I was beat down to a pulp
Rocking back and forth somewhere
If you knew, if you saw
You'd have said it was the final straw
There my life was bound and tethered
On a porch by the shore
But there is no, no, no, no, no
Easy way to tell one so
The things you know
And run, run, run, run, run
When they say they think they know
Exactly so
[Chorus]
It’s not right, it’s not right
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we?
Who are they?
Who says those bastards don’t deserve to pay?
Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers
We don’t stand a chance
So long as they're around you're just another song and dance
It’s not fair (It’s not fair), It’s not fair (It’s not fair)
Still I’m the only one who seems to care

[Verse 2]
It’s funny being funny
Makes you feel like up and running
When your past lingers like rain clouds
Casting shadows below
I could live with so many burdens
I'll take all your hope and yearning
But there's no way I won't take me
For their petty little woes
I used to glow, glow, glow, glow, glow
Once I had a love to show
A love they know
But they’re slow, slow, slow, slow, slow
So slow that they never know
Where I go

I’m just working with what I’ve been given
It’s not my fault, I’m happy

Where the Sky Hangs Lyrics[Verse 1]
It goes up, it goes down
It goes any way the wind would
Like to throw it around
I was lost, now I'm found
I put my hands in the air
And my knees to the ground, yeah
The pieces of the all
That I could only hold, yeah
I could never say what you want me to say
[Refrain]
I've got somebody else
Just to keep me on my toes again
I can barely stand
When you're coming too close

[Chorus]
I get caught up in your heartstrings
Way up, where another sky hangs
I'll take all that I can get
Just don't make me go
Go,go

[Verse 2]
Was it here? Was it there?
Was it swirling around us in the atmosphere?
Is it us? Is it them?
It's the ones plucking the petals
'til we're left with the stem
The people push it forward
My body can't afford it
I step up and take it
But I fall to the side

[Refrain]
I've got somebody else
Just to keep me on my toes again

The wires cross. They got crossed (Hey)
And I got lost, yeah I got lost
So what's it costing me
To get right back to you?

Can you remember ever having any fun?
Cause when all it's all said and done
I always believed we were
But now I'm not so sure

Reality from what I dream
Now no one believes me

Moth’s Wings Lyrics[Verse 1: Passion Pit]
Dear friend, as you know
Your flowers are withering
Your mother's gone missing
Your leaves have drifted away
But the clouds are clearing up
And I've come reveling
Burning incandescently
Like a bastard on the burning sea

[Chorus: Passion Pit]
You're just like your father
Buried deep under the water
You're resting on your laurels
And stepping on my toes
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyway?
Put down your sword and crown
Come lay with me on the ground
[Verse 2: Passion Pit]
You come beating like moth's wings
Spastic and violently
Whipping me into a storm
Shaking me down to the core
But you run away from me
And you left me shimmering
Like diamond wedding rings
Spinning dizzily down on the floor

[Chorus: Passion Pit]
You're just like your father
Buried deep under the water
You're resting on your laurels
And stepping on my toes
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyway?
Put down your sword and crown
Come lay with me on the ground

Cry Like a Ghost Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh on my own, where I found you alone
You were caught up in somebody else's mess
And yes, I drank all those drinks on my own
My life's become some blurry little quest

And the clock kept ticking slowly
And you leaned over and asked me
If I even had a clue where I was
Well I lied down on your wood floors
And my brain and body took course
And the night ended as though it never was
It all began to feel insane
I wanna know where they keep the rain

[Chorus]
Sylvia, right back where you came from
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb but
Sylvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough is enough

[Verse 2]
Sick to the bone on the steps to my home
The moon shined through the drapery of leaves
To hurt, to ignore everyone on my own
But you love just to feel some made-up breeze

But as my body crumbled, you walked as I just stumbled
And we spoke only of things made in my head
You never once controlled me while all the others told me
That if I kept on going, I'd be dead

It's not just you who felt the pain
Now tell me where they keep the rain

[Chorus]

You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb but

To Kingdom Come Lyrics[Verse 1]
That's a frosty way to speak
To tell me how to live next to your potpourri
All this talking pulls my teeth
I believed in you so you'd believe in

[Chorus]
Me, I cried out "God!"
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
So now I hide in piles
Of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me
How it'd always feel
[Verse 2]
Once I had a name to claim
I scraped on all the walls
Like an orthodox saint
I wish for the same old things
That turned me inside out
Keeling in such pain
It's a game

[Chorus]
Me, I cried out "God!"
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
So now I hide in piles
Of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me
How it'd always feel

[Verse 3]
Never have I ever been
Clutching at your hair
To cure you of some sin
But that's the kind of state I'm in
Swimming in a pool of godly medicine

Come, come hear it, calling me yelling like
If ever there was someone who could make things

Love Is Greed Lyrics[Verse 1]
We want a love
A love for us
We want a selfless love
That we can always say we trust, oh
Love has always been a mockery
Of those in love and scared to be lonely
Don’t want to love, don’t want to hurt
If all that loneliness requires just another’s comfort
Better off being all on your own
There's beauty in being alone
Today we're arguing it’s not worth making
Another person as just yours for the taking
All your hoping and praying
Won't do more than saying that
[Hook]
Love, love, love
Love is just greed
It's almost taken me
But now I can see
Love, love, love
Love is just greed
A selfish little need
You follow or you lead
If we really love ourselves
How do you love somebody else?

[Verse 2]
A love to us, a love to them
It’s just a history repeating itself time and time again
Love is not a veil to hide your voids
All this talk of love just turns to noise
So you want love, a love so tough
That even all its truths don’t seem as though they’re adding up
Haven’t you already had enough?
What's this suffering remind you of?
Someday we’ll all agree it’s not worth making
Another person as yours just for the taking
All your hoping and praying
Won't do more than saying that

[Bridge]
A love all gone is just another story
What’s gone sour once was glory, glory!
If it's romance you want, well, ask for it then
"Honey could you put your arms around me so
Tell me things about you that I wouldn’t know
And tell me that you love me like you do
And maybe I will too"

[Hook]
Love, love, love
Love is just greed
It's almost taken me
But now I can see
Love, love, love
Love is just greed
A selfish little need

How do you love somebody else?Embed

Where We Belong Lyrics[Verse 1]
It’s gotten cold in here
But a solemn warmth draws near
And with a gentle touch of these burdens
And such fears are wiped clear
Who says you ought to stay?
How’s this the easier way?
It’s far from giving up
Cowards never say enough is enough

[Verse 2]
And then I’m lifted up
Out of the crimson tub
The bath begins to drain
And from the floor he prays away
All my pain
Who says that God exists?
We kiss the icons of myths, but
Well, I believe in you
Do you believe in me, too?
Gabriel?
[Chorus]
All the things you can’t control
Should never destroy the love one holds
I found a place
I found a place
I found a place where we belong

[Bridge]
Never did I think I'd be lifted to whitest clouds
Never did I ever think I'd find out all the things I found
It's hard to keep on living when your heart weighs 'bout a million pounds
All I ever wanted was to be happy and make you proudYou might also like6Embed

For Sondra (It Means the World to Me) LyricsDarling, I know that you still take care of me
It means the world to me
And my life sways back and forth like the light from above
It’s true, now we we both can see opportunity
Or our chance

But, mother, you knew your love kept on hurting me
But you're my family, why would you?
But father and you, you tried to take care of me
But she came through for me, either side
She became my sun, my moon
She’s my evergreen

Until We Can’t (Let’s Go) Lyrics[Verse 1]
How much can we take before we both break down?
The confines of these rooms, yeah they get you too
Lying in our bed while tossing and turning
And it wakes you up, it puts you in the mood
But that's alright cause
We both know what the other wants
And it goes to show why we're not alone
And still we're here in this God forsaken place
I can hear what you're saying, I can see it on your face
[Chorus]
So let's go, let's go 'til we can't anymore
Let's go 'til we can't
Let's go, let's go 'til we fall to the floor
Let's go 'til we can't
Somebody else told me something about
Where you live can cause you suffering
Guess that's something else that's wrong with our room
With the walls colliding
Someone said stop hesitating
We both know we're suffocating
Let's go out and find ourselves a home
And find ourselves a home

[Verse 2]
Honey please, you don't need to tell me
What we need, yeah we both know that
Our bedroom floor with our clothes strewn all about
Yeah we're stuffed in here together begging for a new way out

[Chorus]
So let's go, let's go 'til we can't anymore
Let's go 'til we can't
Let's go, let's go 'til we fall to the floor
Let's go 'til we can't
Somebody else told me something about
Where you live can cause you suffering

Eyes as Candles Lyrics[Verse 1]
My world astir and sickly
Spits out our voices singing
"Tra la la la" on high now
To kingdom come so slightly
Herein a void in your place
I twitch and tweak in allusion
To sit and stare so blankly
Until all hope is used up

[Chorus]
Why do I always need to need you when you're fleeting?
Where do you go when I'm around?
What have I done, what have I lost that's so defeating?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?
[Hook x4]
Oh na na na na na na hey hey hey hey

[Verse 2]
In some dark room
A smoky figure fills me full
Makes my head swell in ruin
My family kneels at their pew
They nod, "We believe in what you're doing"
I feel it rise above me
The western landscapes towering
And from my shell of a body
The flowers blossom for picking

[Chorus]
Why do I always need to need you when you're fleeting?
Where do you go when I'm around?
What have I done, what have I lost that's so defeating?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?

[Hook x4]
Oh na na na na na na hey hey hey hey

[Breakdown]
I've waited and waited for someone to take it
Don't fight it, don't bother, an inch for another
Don't listen, don't hear them, they're in this together
I've learned well; now hear me, there's much to be fearing
I'm used to your absence, your faceless distractions
I've painted your patterns but found them attractive
Now I've been leaning towards a life far more candid
Though lead through the dark with your eyes as my candles
Where your life and my life's directions can wrangle
And all of a sudden you've left me to handle
The reasons that never forbid me to stand tall
And somehow, or somewhere, I found out the secret
To staying alive without actually breathingYou might also like2Embed

Mirrored Sea Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well he called the whole thing such a wild mistake
He said he didn't mean no harm
Well it was a big to-do
But nothing else was new
His past checkered like checkerboards in Central Park
You do good in the light and the bad in the dark
Good men are scarce and few
But always passing through

[Hook]
Oh, you mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
They're all I see
Oh, let me be you mirrored sea
Your waves, they’re haunting me
Oh, mirrored sea
Leave me be
[Verse 2]
Born with a chance that everybody takes
With all risk and hardly any reward
Bounce off the wall of your teens
Like in a pinball machine
Slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life
Like overheard insults or a cheating wife
And then it's down for the count
The lost that won't be found

Whole Life Story Lyrics[Verse 1]
You had something else you had to say
But it doesn't matter now
Because we always talk in circles
Always circling
Yeah they're talking 'bout our faces
And it shakes you 'til you cry
Now you're stuck inside their world
Getting tangled in the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
And yes it's true, they don't know us
They don't know me, they don't know you
[Chorus]
Oh well, I'm sorry darling, how could I have turned this
Into such a darning, difficult position for you?
Sorry darling, how could you forgive me when
Our life's some story out for them to buy?
Don't you let go
Oh don't you let go
Don't you let go
Don't you let go
Oh don't you let go

[Verse 2]
I made my case, you sat and crossed your arms
And you didn't make a sound
You were looking out the window at the city
Then you turned and said you loved me
And it took me by surprise
You were perching in your corner
And I couldn't see your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And yes it's true, they don't know us
They don't know me, they don't know you

Somewhere Up There LyricsBaby, I get so lost
I saw you falling apart and I thought it was all my fault
But now you sing
Oh, how you sing!
With your voice like an angel attached to a broad pair of wings
But that’s the point
Because once we joined
The crowd started screaming and we couldn’t hear over the noise you spoke and said—
(But in my head, I kept passing the blame for excuses to help me tread)

Oh, caught in the middle of deceptions
Just to get a part of the others, our authority figures
That would look like the others
The truths and the liars that were holding us both to the flames
So, now I cry -- I’m only trying to turn our hell to reality
And it’s so divine
Because the pain
And the time it takes to end all of the talking
And finally meet on a plane
And up there somewhere
And up there somewhere


[Spoken]
You know when children are very little, the child-mother, or nurturer, let's call her mother. The mother bond is developed- from day one, starts real early and continues
There are three fundamental attachments that you can be:
Secure, ambivalent
Or distant
...in your attachment -- in other words, insecure in your attachment. So, um...

I’m Perfect Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've heard everything about you and what you've done
You're over the money but under the gun
You came in the front door, so where can you run?
At least the party's over

You're moving slower than you mean to, but it's over at last
You cry because you missed it, it went by too fast
"The whole world's against you," you say, then you ask
Where all your friends have gone to
[Chorus]
Just tell, tell me I'm so damn perfect
Tell me it all of the time, oh
Tell me I'm so damn perfect
Tell me it all of the time

Tell, tell me I'm so damn perfect
Tell me it all of the time, oh
Tell me I'm so damn perfect
Tell me it all of the time

[Verse 2]
Thank you!
(And thank you again!)
You're brutal, you're honest
You're my very best-friend
It's not like you asked me if our night had to end at one of my brother's parties

Oh, what can I do?
When the face is a mirror of flattering youth
And all of the work that you say that you'll do
You've barely even started
Can't you...

Your clouds, your blanket and my pity song
Hovering on your front lawn
Carry on until it's gone

What can I do?
The river is overrun
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch
But the water is rising up

Then I lie naked in a rampage
In the flesh, face to face with the onset
I forget everything that's ever made me rise again
Now slowly leave my memory

I thought I felt your touch
But the water is rising up
Now all my lovers raise their cups

On My Way Lyrics[Verse 1]

Walls of her own home
Oh God, Kristina
Don’t once think that
This madness is my fault alone
Now a nightmare’s in the hands
Still everyday’s another chance

I’m on my way, I’m on my way
Let’s get married, I’ll buy a ring and then we'll
Consecrate this messy love

Realize how busy I am
We’re both so broken, done long hoping
Is that we'll stumble upon our love again
Just believe in me, Kristina
All these demons, I can beat them

The Undertow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come to me honey and feel the warmth around you grow
Calls from above me, echoes down below
We've resorted to the undertow
I try, but what you're feeling is the undertow, tow
How can you ever [?] so high
Well surely you have wondered why
Waves still crashing, tides of love
Running all our hope, hope
And they crash upon the shores 'til we know
[Chorus]
We know what we need, clear and immediately
A love concrete, spelling it out on the street
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see, my darling
We know what we need, clear and immediately
A love concrete, spelling it out on the street
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see, my darling

[Verse 2]
Shot down from under what we never should be
Close to your body, I am taking your lead
But maybe it's the undertow
But I lie, I'll just tell them it's the undertow
Off to a little bit of what could've been a bit of love burning feverishly
Skip through the thick of it and watch as I fill up with the forces that take over me
Oh, take me away from all this foolish grief, baby
Wake me once you know our home and that's where we'll stay

[Chorus]
We know what we need, clear and immediately
A love concrete, spelling it out on the street
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see, my darling

To the Other Side Lyrics[Verse 1]
What for?
You know it don't matter like it did before
Fight your war wrapped up in a blanket on your living room floor
What you need?
You're a goddamn human, you're already set free
Wish you knew, wish you talked about me like I talk about you

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I am letting you down
I was just trying to turn it around
[Chorus]
Because I made it to the other side
Our bodies rose and went with the tide
I landed on the shore when I lost you, oh
But I, reaching from the other side
Slipping deeper, further each time
The sun beat down on me when I lost you

[Verse 2]
What use?
What more can you dwell on just to seek an excuse
Don't you cry -- don't you place yourself above it because you won't try
Look at these! I mean, Jesus, can't you look at this?
It really ain't a dream
Wish you knew -- wish you knew I still love you and could control what I do

Because I am letting you down
I was trying to turn it around

Because I made it to the other side

Constant Conversations (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Uh huh
Let's never leave
Ooo ohooo ooo, never
I said never ever leave
Let's never, no

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
The only reason that I'm fly
You stress me out I stay super high
You rolling up, I'm never home
I know it's tough, she done had enough
Ghost love story like Patrick Swayze
Back of the Ghost like Miss Daisy
One night we goin' ride to Vegas
Let's get married and make a baby
I'm in love and she ain't trippin'
She leave me alone when a ninja sippin'
Between the legs they wet and drippin'
For Juicy J to go skinny dippin'
Make up sex everytime we break up
She be fussin', I be baked up
Love the way he go up and down
In the sheets when a ninja wake up
She sprung keep it motivate
Even though I stay vegigate
Drunk texting all through the night
Frustated so intoxicated
She don't understand I'm out tryna' gettin' this paper
Dirty ratchets chasing me, but I ain't tryna' be Flava
Never on bean
She's in the cream
Get to shakin'
Just like a fiend
Get ya naked
Get ya faded
Then I'm busting
Up in your jeans
Hard body classes like John West
And her pussy hit hard like Ron Artest
[Verse 2]
Well you're wrapped up in a blanket
And you're staring at the floor
The conversation's moderated
By the noisy streets below
I never wanna hurt you baby
I'm just a mess with the name and the prize
And now I'm drunker then before babe
Told me drinking doesn't make me nice

[Chorus]
You never know where some people will go
Yes some people been hurting me
You can tell by the look, by the slightest crook
In the neck or a blink of an eye
Well then they'll say what they say
And they'll do what they do
But it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
You can listen if you want, you can listen if you don't
Get a talk, yell and even sing
Everybody now
Oo ooh ooo
The come sing into the window, sing into the trees
Yea they sing into the bright spring leaves
Everybody now

My Brother Taught Me How to Swim Lyrics[Verse 1]
My brother taught me how to swim
We treaded water underneath the ocean's skin
And then he washed away my sins
He held me closer as the tide was coming in

[Chorus]
But then why, what could I say?
What would it mean?
Cause then I, I'd give away
All the love I need
Just a child, always waiting
All along he elevated
He stayed put while I was wandering
Gone so long he started wondering
Why, I got lost
[Verse 2]
My brother taught me how to give
He spreads his love until it stretches too thin
Oh how I wanna be like him
He takes away the weight before your heart caves in

[Chorus]
But then why, what could I say?
What would it mean?
Cause then I, I'd give away
All the love I need
Just a child, always waiting
All along he elevated
He stayed put while I was wandering
Gone so long he started wondering
Why, I got lost

If I loved the way my brother loves (I got lost)
None of it would have been like the way that it was

You Have the Right Lyrics[Verse 1]
It only went higher with feet to the fire
Your hands on my shoulders, my lips to your hands
And grass so much greener and air that much clearer
You draw your breath nearer wherever I am
How it rose, how it feels in the minor
And desires turned major that say you
Ho oh

[Chorus]
You have the right to look away
And take a night or take a day
And time after time it comes to you
How could you barely even choose?
You'll never win and you will not lose
And time after time I will trust you
[Verse 2]
It bends at the knees and it sends you its feelings
In packages wrapped with your eyes sung and blue
On choosing the answers, you pray till your hands hurt
No, love's not an answer till it ends up all loose
Well body rose, body feels in the minor
Biding all of the time till we choose you

[Chorus]
You have the right to look away
You may take a night or take a day
And time after time it comes to you
How could you barely ever choose?

Hideaway Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who could love you in the way that you love you?
You're alone darling and there's nothing to argue
Your life revolves to ruin
Everyone's watching all that you're doing
Just say your head's done in, maybe you should start running

[Hook]
Hideaway, hideaway
Where they'll never say you cannot stay
Come and play, my hideaway
Someday everything will be okay
[Verse 2]
You’re not strong so you
You could hurt her so badly
You don’t mean to
Hurting her is too maddening
When you do it's a war in your hand
What you mean to say isn't always what's said
Take a deep breath as soon as you've let go

[Hook]

[Bridge]
What's the point to this, feeling happiness in life?
As we fight off our demise, or love as we play into it's lies

Looks Like Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
All the rivers are bending
And the mountains are peaking
And the flowers are blooming
And the meadows are rolling
Into waves that rush upon the shore
And barely touch your toes
The clouds are crowding 'round us
For some reason, no one knows
And I said
[Chorus]
"Hey, looks like rain"
Then you lifted your hands and prayed
Go away
You can come back some other day
But they stayed
And you soaked under all of the grey
And the rain
Washed all our cries and pleas away

[Verse 2]
Now the season is changing
And the leaves now are turning
And the birds aren't singing
And the grass isn't green anymore
Than it used to be when the sunbeams lit it up
And the clouds are crowding 'round us just to say they've had enough
And I said

[Chorus]
"Hey, looks like rain"
Then you lifted your hands and prayed
Go away
You can come back some other day
But they stayed
And you soaked under all of the grey
And the rain
Washed all our cries and pleas away

And now the current takes us out and all the ripples turn to waves
The wind begins caressing all the branches to a sway
The air shattered like glass and fell like crystals on your face
I took you in my arms, and I could hear you saying grace
Then I said

[Chorus]
"Hey, looks like rain"
Then you lifted your hands and prayed
Go away
You can come back some other day
But they stayed
And you soaked under all of the grey
And the rain
Washed all our cries and pleas awayEmbed

Make Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
So now we see, comes burying my burnt remains
These puddled clouds
Oh I, I understand now

But darkness falls like shattered pieces
Dangling, shimmering
Torn and tattered yet crowned
Oh, I'll not be told "no" to, no more

You must believe to hear me sing these
Messy morsels of my self-assuring love
Oh, it's painful kneading
Yes, I lie and I wrangle with prospective angles
That glare me down and face me
With all I do wrong
Why do they all look like me?

[Chorus]
So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh
Just to prove I'm alive, and it's alright
Cause tonight there's a way I'll make light
Of my treacherous life

[Verse 2]
If I had hands I'd hold up high
My lofty dreams, my alibi's real name
But I have no strength

So I toss and I turn and I spit in the urn
There's a ghost in your eye
There is someone that knows more than I
But I'm quick to deny

[Chorus]
So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh
Just to prove I'm alive, and it's alright
Cause tonight there's a way I'll make light
Of my treacherous life

Cuddle Fuddle Lyrics[Verse 1]
I filled the bucket
I spilled the bucket
Out on the floor
A mistake for sure

Consequences
Turned me hostile
I got so tied in
Made me docile
Then you applauded
When I was loving
Made me feel weak and
I start recovering

Now I feel silly
Selfish and dizzy
Now I got this feeling
That you'll forgive me

[Hook]
And you know
Oh my God, just please don't ever let me go
Yeah, sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Put up with me then I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me

[Verse 2]
That was the night we
Kissed in the moonlight
It was romantic
But didn't feel so right

Cause something was lost then
Today it's replenished
But it was you who
Cleaned up my messes

Five Foot Ten (I) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said I'm wrong and that I'm 5 foot 10
Darling what you do to me! You're living in my head
I'm not as strong as I was way back then
So I'm guarding all my history, no it won't come up again

All alone, I wanna be
All alone, the two of us

Let's play a game, learn what we thought we knew
Well aren't you all so proud of me? Have you seen all I can do?
Okay I'm learning what I'm saying's not true
But all this generosity, and now all of your perfume

Dreams Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh my life is changing everyday
Every possible way
Though my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems

I know I felt like this before
But now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
Then I open up and see
The person falling here is me

Impossible to ignore
They'll come true, impossible not to do

Dancing on the Grave Lyrics[Verse 1]
There is the sun that I belong to
There hangs a light that comes and shines upon you
Bear off the warmth, Bear off reminders of youth
Oh we can't stay here
Tear down the moon and all its mockery
There is the sun that takes away our money
The night is deafening and brings on defeat
No we can't stay here, no I can't stay here
No I can't stay here
[Chorus]
Someone told me that I've run too far away, away
Someone told me I should just give in and stay, and stay
Oh come and celebrate, we're dancing on the grave
Of the nights we couldn't sleep, or I can't stay here

[Verse 2]
Don't steal away all of her beauty
Take down the darkness bruising both of your knees
It better overwhelm the heart with the heat
Or I can't stay here, no we can't stay here
No I can't stay here

[Chorus]
Someone hold me as I turn the night away, away
Someone hold me to the ultraviolet rays, arrays
Oh come and celebrate, yeah we're dancing on the grave
Of the nights we couldn't sleep, or I can't stay here

Ten Feet Tall (II) Lyrics[Verse 1]
They knocked me down and I grew 10 feet tall
They say they know what's good for me, they say to take it slow
Well I can't slow down, cause I want it all
Darling what's it say about me? It cuts me to the bone

[Chorus]
It's all I'll ever know
It's all I'll ever know
It's everything I own
It's all I'll ever know

These motherfuckers and their goddamn "woes"
Claiming what they say's what goes, pretending no one knows
They push me back, yeah, back against the wall
Saying I better sing these songs, and sing 'em all night long

American Blood Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh American Blood
In my eyes and on my hands
Such an awful circumstance
Condone, carry your woes
Just strike a match and then a pose
But for whom? nobody knows

[Hook]
And we're going to be alright
And you're gonna keep me safe this night
And we're going to be alright
Everything will be quite alright for
You and me
For you and me
For you and me

Oh American Blood
How my love always was young
How it always felt so fun
And then, oh, you went to my head
All my limbs instantly dead
Upside down dangling by a thread

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Whats it feel like?
Whats it feel like to be alone?
Whats it hurt like?
Does it hurt you because you know
That all of your blood
Could wash away the world in one massive wave
Could reach the highest peak and the deepest cave

The world starts leaving webs of love

Seaweed Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some day you'll see
Surrounded by angels
Floating atop of the sea
On bended knee
Don't go where they go
Don't sing all the songs they sing

Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do
Well, I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
Nobody knows you

Between these walls
Her bark-stripped limbs
Casts shadows frighteningly tall
I slow to a crawl
I jump and I yell
And she hears nothing at all

Smile Upon Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everything's always better
Whenever I'm at rest
I'm wound up tighter than
A dried up birds nest
And it's the truth, you know
That's always the issue
But when it starts getting blurry
One's never better than two

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine

Oh yeah, you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
You'll always smile upon me when the season's bad
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too

[Verse 2]
I don't know what I need now
Since everything has changed
But if I did know one thing
It's me who's feeling strange
'Cause everything is different
And I don't react well
To changes that come when
Your life's becoming hell

There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine

Let Your Love Grow Tall Lyrics[Verse 1]
In pastures blue and green
I'll follow you and you'll follow me
My fabrics mystery
I'll wave your loyalty in the freezing
Breeze so desperately

[Chorus]
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
[Verse 2]
I think I see my life
He bows all slyly and gentle-like
He's never had the right
I've never lived without
His sad and jealous eyes

[Chorus]
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
They'd say
Let your love grow tall
Let your love grow tall
Tall as the grass in the meadow?
Or the dunes on the shore?
Like the buildings in the city?
And your children on the floor?

But it's the thought that counts
Quiet minds don't know their worth

I’ve Got Your Number LyricsI've always felt so scared of all this needing
Everyone that I've met has been somewhat mistreated
That's how it feels when you know that something's wrong

Then you came along like a swan off of the lake
You flew across my eyes and out into space
And I ran and I crawled and I chased to get a taste
That's what I did

If there's just one thing you got to remember
Is to write down your name and your phone number
That way I'll have it and we'll make something out of this mess
And if all else fails then the ship won't set sail
God forbid but I guess the both of us will bail
But as far as I can tell, I think things will be swell

Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster

Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at

So now the two of us rely on each other
With our premonitions out in the gutter
Who would have thought that I'd make it this far?

I'll make it seem like I'm stronger but I'm quite the actor
And now I'm so caught up and I can't escape this pattern
But when I started losing hope, there you were, there you bloomed

Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster

Better Things Lyrics[Intro]
That was our fifth song
And I hope you enjoyed it
Now this would be our best song
That you have ever heard
The dirt bike's going on stage
Thank you

[Hook 1]
You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' heavens out of less
[Verse 1]
I believe in believing
The things that we don't see
And the skin violin is where
The neighbors won't read meals
And the family heirloom jewelry
With sets and heaps of thieves
Will cast down things
That you've never ever seen

Like the gods, like the glory, like the stories
That your fathers set before you
Like the tide that overcame you, oh no
Oh no, resonating in the canyons
Oh no, this is rising to the clouds

[Hook 2]
You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins out of glass

Baby, don't be unhappy
Baby, don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting off the cannons
And the clouds begin to flow
And the baskets weave but the ones heap
Are the ones we'll never keep
You might also likeJust pretend that things are mobile
And they're never staying put
And the way we were the day
We climbed to the top of the steeple

With it's people spewing angels out their mouths
And letting tables turn to charcoal
In the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening
Oh no, we were waving like the trees
Oh no, then they moved us to the sky

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Two or three times the bell will ring
It's when we look for the better things
We search for this, we all have none
I feel it crash upon your skin

I find it hard to believe there's more
Of these things behind the door
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Do I miss you like you miss me?

Folds in Your Hands LyricsLeave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I'm fine
I'll be fine until the morning comes
Then unmask me in the blistering sun

Oh let me go
Just let me go
Just let me go
Or I'll burst in front of your eyes
Then collect myself from the ground
And when I go
And when I go
Just let me go
Like a light
Flickering out in the skies
Lost as fast as was found

[Chorus]
Everything is easy when you never have to choose
But the balance has shifted and we're forced to lose
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you til you bloom
I will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to you

Lay low
Don't let me know when it's real
Will they quietly follow me here?
Will they take me as their own?
Now I will hold you I will keep you I'll control my love
Until it folds in my hands
But I'll build it back to the top

[Chorus]
Everything is easy when you never have to choose
But the balance has shifted and we're forced to lose
