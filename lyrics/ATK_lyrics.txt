Put It on Me Lyrics[Intro: Ja Rule]
What would I be without you?

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
What would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Girl, it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind, body and soul ain't no I in we (Baby)
When you cry, who wipes your tears?
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear?
Girl, I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See, Jacob's and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl, put it on me

What would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (Yeah)

So baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)

[Verse 2: Vita]
Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy, we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July, it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy, put it on me

Since we met, it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby, eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon' cry
If you leave me lonely
'Cause you not just my love, you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control, hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world, it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
'Cause every thug needs a lady (Yeah, yeah)
I feel you, baby, 'cause them eyes ain't lying
Wash away all the tears, there be no more crying (Baby)
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me

Always on Time Lyrics[Intro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
[Outro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

I got a fetish for fuckin' you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
'Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
'Cause every woman just wanna be happy
And it's CRA-ZAY, but BAY-BAY, I... (love it when I'm witchu, baby)

And there's a better day, a-comin, I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin
Like when we kissin' - bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll - ride ride ride
So take me, tonight

You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
Baby, I can only help but wonder
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)
Ah-ah-ah
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
It's a man's world, but I understand
But there's still nothin' different, boy, stick to the plan

New York Lyrics[Intro: Dre]
This is, this is, this, this is, this is
This is, this is
I got a hundred guns

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York, New York
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk, you talk
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York, New York
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk, you talk
And I know
[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Y'all niggas is pussy, punani, vagina
Your monologue's getting tired, now it's time to ride
Apprentice, you fired, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire; Harley dipped in octane
Let East Coast bang, let West Coast bang
And Rule gon' bring the ghetto gospel (Ooh!)
To every hood possible, pushing through in the sky blue
Back with the Gods, you now, preferably the four pound
Slugs flying at the speed of sound
Tryna catch the ears of niggas that's running they mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the running's about
But we hunters, we take pride in airing our prey out
Leaving 'em laid out dead in just a sport
'Cause we ain't playing up here in New York

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga I'm from New York, New York (Yes, hahaha)
And you can tell the way the homie spit (Woo!)
That nigga I'm from New York, New York (BX, BX, uh)
I got a hundred ways to make a grip (Uh, uh)
Yes, I'm from New York, New York (Yes, uh)
And you can tell I get real ignorant (Blat, blat, blat, blat!)
'Cause nigga I'm from New York, New York
And this is how we do

Nigga, I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find God
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a ménage
And everybody talking crazy how they AK spit
But we done did some 'vestigating and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth, homie, got the industry shook
Like, "Naw, nigga, Joe gon' let 'em loose on me"
True story, I'm bringing the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to lean back (Lean back)
My nigga Dre said, "grind, Cook", now we killing them hard
Niggas said I must've found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling like the ring around Saturn
Cook Coke Crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the X is where the team be at, uhh

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York, New York (Yeah)
Ruff Rydin', D-Block and shit
Nigga, fuck what you thought, you thought (A-ha!)
And you can't take shit for granted
'Cause life is too short, too short (Yeah)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips (Uh, yeah)
Nigga, I'm from New York (Uh, ah-heh!)
And this is how we do
[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, I swear it couldn't be sweeter, life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gon' die, you might get missed
For maybe two or three hours 'til they light they spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken, and you know they say that you deserved it
Whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold the title
'Cause I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doing shit for nothin', it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of 'gnac and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment
Ha-heh!

[Chorus: Ja Rule, Fat Joe, Jadakiss & All]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York, New York
And you can tell the way the homie spit
That nigga I'm from New York, New York
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York, New York
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk (Ah-heh!)

That half a dollar, that nickel, them dimes, and died like penny"
And Murder Inc. will send they deepest condolences and sympathies
To Aftermath and Shady, Interscope and Jimmy Iovine
Ya know your team they really some peons
Gettin peed on and linked on
I'm talkin' about faggot ass gay Dre Young
And Suge told me all about how you used to take transvestites home
And occasionally wear thongs
No wonder Feminem be cross dressin' in pumps and tight little dresses
My pumps they leave big messes
And I know the Truth Hurts when I bust reckless
Battle of the sexes, is that a woman or a man?
I really don't care to stand, but 50 you gon' get shot again

Twin Benz's, you ride hard, I ride drop
And to make it better, baby got the nina' Beretta tucked low
And I'm two cars back with the four-four
And who freaks you out, on your momma's couch
That's what us thugs be 'bout
You know me
And while I pray for love, baby pray for us
Who celebrates the thugs?
My lady
Got me seekin capital game when I spit sixteen
Whether bars or sixteens in the doors of cars
A star is born
In the hood, made a name live on
R-U-L-E, ladies, feel me

The death and the life of a bitch and a thug, is what I'm scared of
But got a woman that ain't afraid to, tuck the toast in the Escalade
Pop on niggas that showin me shade, but only for the Rule cause that's my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don't care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c'mon, follow me, and bust back at police, conceal ya heat
It's a bit much to blaze up
Rule and Chuck and I.G., the Murderers, I-N-C
With one on the hip, one in the holster, nigga will toast ya quick
Especially a down ass bitch

[Chorus]
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd lie for me, like you lovin me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd die for me, like you cry for me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd kill for me, like you comfort me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
Girl I'm convinced, you're my down ass bitch

[Bridge: Ja Rule]
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, ladies
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, baby
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, ladies
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, baby

[Chorus] X2
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd lie for me, like you lovin me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd die for me, like you cry for me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd kill for me, like you comfort me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
Girl I'm convinced, you're my down ass bitch

Vita thighs only divide if you inside, 'cause I

And if it's comin' or gunnin' just consider it's spittin'
So when you gone for a minute, I just fantasize
Like if it's you that's all in it, then I'm satisfied
'Til you come back to me, holdin' stacks and jewels

The booty a lil' plumper and it's (All for Rule)
Shit, who gon' love you like that? Thug with you
With it stacked to the ceiling or splittin' a dub with you

Poppin' my collar, patnah - who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot; and the mug and the watch ugly
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they don't trust me
And they say I'm lucky; you think I got time
To blow all this dough and do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama chargin white Rolls

We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus we hit it off like first sight in "Love Jones"
Been in, many zones, baby love it all hate it all
From, prissy women to women who go to shadows
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up

I wanna, feel your passion, come when you askin'
Laugh when you cryin', cry when you laughin
But ain't nothing happenin', a girl got a little uptight
Turned off the light and then started crashin'
The radio blastin' "Between Me and You"
But, you ain't on the low with that freaky thing you do
Girl I thought you knew (what I do), know I know

(All we need is a a stage, God, shit)
Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, yeah

Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored, baby

[Verse 1: Ja Rule, Bobby Brown & Both]
I know you're living your life faithfully, safely, away from me (Woo!) But you miss being next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you want
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
Or intervene
Of me peeling your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
Shoes 19, coming through in that new Bentley thing (GIRL!!)
The talk of the town, the tease of the city (yeah)
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy or Bob and Whitney (WHO?)
I'm here 'cause the Lord sent me (WHO?), pound puss like a pugilist
Grin real devilish and freak bad bitches (oh-ohh)
Forget the story, I know you're getting bored
And that nigga ain't getting you horny no more, is he?

Loving, thugging you, baby...

[Verse 2: Ja Rule, Bobby Brown & Both]
Sweet thing, living it
Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent (ha)
Maybe I'm too generous
Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even (girl, I know)
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God?
Betrayal, trust, this thing of ours  (GIRL!!)
Should be secretly held sacred, 'cause I love it when you pop your body-body
And move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi and rub up alongside me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is you need my heat (Ja!)
'Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Loving, thugging you, baby...
[Chorus: Bobby Brown (Ja Rule)]
And I know you're getting bored

Rule, baby
Baby girl, here I'm holding your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless (WOOOO!!!)
'Cause you been getting at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck from strays
'Cause I been in a rage (GIRL!!) lately (yeah)
Hoping God'll forgive me for all the sin, all the women
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginning (WOOOO!!!)
I hope you (watch) so you could see that nigga ain't built like me (like me)
Black Sheep of the family
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love looking something like soft porn
Now tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him?
Where the brightest of days just look dim
And you fucking with a loser, baby, you can't win (HA, HA)
When it's said and done you're gonna need me
Loving, thugging you, baby...

Yo, now when I first met her all I thought was, "Thong thong-thong"

Baby know the game, slip away, and slide me yo' number
It's the last day of spring, see you first day this summer
I'm a bad motha, shut yo' mouth, pull the drop out and
Creep at a low speed, 'cause homie probably know me
I push the pedal, thoughts of your stiletto
Way up in the air like I think he's here
'Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (With you)
Homey be checkin' up on you (On you)
But if that nigga only knew (Only knew)
You've got a lot of freak in you, baby
Well, now it's startin' to rain, I pop the roof and the champagne
How Jay said? "Money Ain't a Thing"
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, baby

[Chorus: Christina Milian & (Ja Rule)]

[Verse 1]
Fuck what they hollerin' about Rule, nigga, here's the real
I'll pop ya top like champagne bottles to chill
With nothing but ice, now I'll send it up to the greatest
To tell 'em I'm nice too, plus push some nice coupes
The Inc. roll like deuce, man, I'm OG Bobby J
And we slinging soccer fields of yay
They don't respect that, don't get your mind around me
Get it pushed back, y'all don't want that
I send 'em to the morgue while keepin' my bitches bouncin' for sure
In the club with no gun, got 'em taking it off
Can't help that, I'm the nigga that puts it down
Once I hit that, that's it, I'm up in the mind, maxin' them
Holdin' the throwback, West, 44, Lakers
Let's make no mistakes when these F's take place
What's the procedure with a gun in your face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (C'mon), we gon'

[Verse 2]
The Rule be in the club, rude motherfucker poppin' the bubbly
When shit get ugly, I hug the snub closely
But usually used to seein' your bitches
Dancin' on some freak shit, trying to ride my dick
I can handle it long as they manage
To get they ass in front of my dick and dance to BIG's "One More Chance"
I'm catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggas is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit a shank
Give bitches the back hand, this pimp shit, it's not realistic
Your game is helpless, let's not get it twisted
I'm young, Black, and gifted, but still at the bottom
And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Sodom
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the dog, we werewolves is out on the prowl
What's the procedure when you got a gun on you face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (C'mon), we gon'

We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)

[Verse 3]
Like Bush and Saddam, I'm a find out
Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than your scrubs
Mask and gloves, gun hot to burn that ass up
I'd rather be bossed up with a bunch of broads
The preacher's daughter screaming out, "Fuck the Lord!"
I may have struck a chord with the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessing to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
And clap that boy like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggas all over my dick like hoes
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come
What's the procedure with a gun in your face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (C'mon), we gon'

[Chorus]
Clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)

[Outro]
Yeah, my nigga 'Zino in this motherfucker (That's how we do it, know what I mean?)
Buck '89, what's up, baby? I see you (Bust it down, nigga, break 'em down)
Bringin' birds in the motherfucking house
It's not a game no more (Queens in this motherfucker)
You know, all my Jersey niggas (All my Boston niggas)
All my Brooklyn niggas, Brooklyn, sir, what up?
Haha, yeah, holla at me, man2Embed

It’s Murda Lyrics[Interlude]
Niggas pushin' rhymes like weight right now (Pushin' rhymes like weight?)
Know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
You gotta push rhymes like weight (You got to, you got to)
It's still a hustle, it's still a hustle, my nigga (Duct tape, rope and shit)
As long as you're Black, your life is gon' be a hustle, nigga (For real, for real)
You know what I mean? (Duct tape, rope) Huh?
I wouldn't even wanna be white, nigga, I'm glad I'm Black
I like it hard, you know what I'm sayin', Gotti? (Hahahaha)
I do it for the struggle, my nigga
[Intro: DMX]
Grr, uh-huh
Y'all motherfuckers is ready or what?
Is y'all motherfuckers ready or what?
I don't think you are
I don't think so

[Verse 1: DMX & JAY-Z]
They got my back against the building, I'm the villain that's creeping around corners
Like, shorty, if you see them niggas creeping around, warn us
We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remember, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need the extra set of eyes so I keep my dog with me
Doctor says, "Let 'em die," shit, his fucking dog bit me
I don't know what's wrong with me, but it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turned into murderers since you couldn't fuck with a third of us
But still against me and wanna see me in the box
Grillin' me all crazy when you see me and The LOX
Leave you red like Foxx, ain't nothing funny about that
ICU up in a coma, you ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and drop another slug on you
It's murda, it's murda (Motherfucker)
You might also like[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I dip, squat, then post up with the toast up
I bring beef to a closure, know something?
From Coxsackie to Folsom, I'm loathsome
I scream out, "Fuck the world," then I throw something
Niggas scheming hard, but fuck it, it's the God
I leave bullets lodged, leave you leaning on your broad
The R pump leave you fucked up in your car
Slumped, Kennedy-style with your memory out
What the fuck y'all want? Daddy-o with the Calico
Let the gatty blow, leave you bleeding on your patio
I leave rivals on they back, looking up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you
I before you, X and Ja Rule
Death before dishonor, now and prior to
Boss man, fire you, expire you
Me die before you? You liar, you
Niggas is dead off the hits I approve
Shit, I got the feds wearin' riot suits
Y'all niggas don't listen, whether streets or in prison
When we find 'em, we twist 'em, niggas waking up missing
Y'all don't understand we want y'all all to hate it
(It's murda) Murder Incorporated
(It's murda) In crime we all related
(It's murda) You niggas see if y'all can fade it
[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
I'm a murderer murdering anything that moves, seeing eye, nigga
It's like do or die, nigga, get caught up and fall victim to the worst shit
X, Jigga, and Ja as expected
Shine on the world and reflect it
Niggas don't respect it, so get it the worst way
Fuckin' with the wolves you get hunted like prey
Shot up in broad day, now everybody marchin'
I'm feeling like, "Stupid, didn't the Inc. warn you the first time?"
(We murda) Whenever you see blood
(It's murda) Layin' it down for the love
That's us, we the life, put the knife through your windpipe
'Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright, nigga, but it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Give a nigga some space or I'm taking it while making you bleed
And if I gotta take, the nigga taking more than he need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up, wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holding the heat? Who leaving niggas cold in the streets?
Y'all know me, ya co-D, Ja Rule the OG
Niggas better watch me closely, get a grip
It's Hennessy that fuels all that murdering shit
When I look in the mirror, my reflection is killer
Jigga, X, Ja, nigga, it's murda7Embed

Caught Up Lyrics[Intro: Ja Rule]
Word to mother, got my nigga Buck 3000 on the boards
Holla back
My nigga Terry, he gon' be the big boy
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayo, ayo, Jody
Hey, you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit
Get that bottle of Voo out the back of the 'Bach for me, baby
I need to get right before I do this here
Uh-huh
[Chorus: Lloyd & Alexi]
(Why me and you) Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
(What we been through) It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you) And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through) Just imagine what life be without me

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Mami, I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward
'Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged
But you ain't too proud to beg
First time we got alone, you gave me some head
And been calling me ever since to do it again
When we met you was a seven, just creeping to ten
And now your my lucky quarter
The days get shorter, nights get longer
You know when the weather is cold feelings grow stronger
What a performer, the pussy feel like walking pneumonia
Got me sniffling and sneezing, coughing and aching and shit
And I'm starting to think I'm falling in love with this bitch
I'm having dreams about her jeans and how they fit
In that ErvingGeoffrey baby tee
She's wearing my name already, so you know she's fucking me
I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards
The only question I ask myself is— Shit

[Chorus: Lloyd & Alexi]
(Why me and you) Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
(What we been through) It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you) And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through) Just imagine what life be without me

Why me? Better yet why you and I?
Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?
Singing "Dangerously In Love"
This a dangerous broad I'm fuckin'
Like Al, it's the "Scent of a Woman"
That got me playing hardball like Doc Gooden
Excuse my intruding, I don't mean to be rude
But our situation is kinda amusin'
'Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other
It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers
And my niggas can't tell us what we been doing is wrong
And your girls getting jealous 'cause we been getting along
Hold on, this is how it all begins
You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends
And hang out at the mansion in the Hamptons on weekends
Then it all ends, and the question is

[Chorus: Lloyd & Alexi]
(Why me and you) Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
(What we been through) It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you) And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through) Just imagine what life be without me

[Bridge: Lloyd]
Have you even been touched like I touch ya?
Been held like I hold ya?
Been loved like I love ya?
Be real, be real
Have you ever been seen like I see you?
Been heard how I hear you?
Been felt how I feel you?
Be real, be real
[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Girl, you're my sunshine
But sometimes it gets a little cloudy don't it?
Them sunny days, I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya
Face, it'd be great to get up every morning
To eggs and steak, but you can't relate
So we separated on good terms, no one's concerned
About who ya be fucking, and who ya fucked last
But when I see you, still the question I ask is

[Chorus: Lloyd & Alexi]
(Why me and you) Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
(What we been through) It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you) And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through) Just imagine what life be without me2Embed

So Much Pain Lyrics[Intro: Ja Rule]
Rest in peace to my nigga Stretch, my nigga 'Pac
So much pain
Uhh.. yeah, huh, yeah
All my, niggas.. so much pain
Uhh.. huh, yeah
Yeah, so.. much..
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
They'll never take me alive
I'm gettin high with my fo'-five
Cocked on these niggas time to die
Even as a lil' nigga, you could picture me hot gun in the rain
I shed the tear, cause this nigga here inherits the pain
And now I'm labeled as a thug nigga - you know the game
Smokin weed, fuckin hoes, slangin thangs, that's the life I live
Even if I tried to go back I'd get lost (come back)
And everything I seem to love I done lost
Fuck the world if they can't understand me
What else could I do? I had to feed my fuckin family
Yo' lies is my truth, so I'm a drug to your youth
And you don't want 'em nowhere near me
Now that they can hear me
I spits razors, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of tote-slangers and chalk lines
Why do we die at an early age?
Nigga so young, but still a victim of a twelve-gauge
Feel the rage this world has bestowed upon me
And I don't give a fuck cause they don't give a fuck 'bout me
So I keep - drinkin Hennessy, bustin at my enemies
Will I live to see twenty-three? There's so much pain
[Hook: Ja Rule]
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Years and years of strugglin all my life
Runnin wild as a kid, grew up blazin 'em right
I'm in a - little cell I call my soul lately
It's been a - givin me hell and my heart is screamin, "Don't enter"
I've been cursed, for what it's worth I feel dead
Spittin to you, I know I'm in way over my head
But Lord hear me, I believe in your "7 Day Theory"
Three souls done sent this whole world teary (can you hear me?)
Too hot for you to stand near me
It's so much pain, and niggas wanna kill me
I'm tired of the stress and the strain
But my, grimiest grimeys got love for me
They're blazin, sendin shotguns up above for me
My face in, Hennessy with no chaser
Coke rises on every way in - keep us hustlin nigga
Me and my man got a plan to get this paper nigga
So if you owe nigga, look for the gauge to blow nigga
I figured I'd be considered a killer
Doin crime excited my mind and leadin the blind
I, can't express my compassion, my satisfaction
For gettin fucked up and blastin - we all been there
Taught from young to shoot, show no fear and lie
And wipe the tears from yo' mother's eyes - so much pain

Cocked on these suckers, time to die

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
They got me mobbin like I'm - loc'd and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckers if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked, playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - PASSION
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - BA-BLASTIN
I'm a nut and drinkin Hennessy
And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why?
Cause the stress gettin major
A buck-fifty 'cross the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real they can not see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin on the streets
And I be, ballin loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin at these suckers 'til you buried
I was born to raise - hell, a nigga from the gutter, word to mother
I'm tough - I'm kickin dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin mean; until they kill me
I'll be livin this life, I know you feel me

I Cry Lyrics[Intro - (O'Jay's sample)]
Said we cry, cry, cry, we cry together, oh, oh

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I love my life, I love my wife, a bad time to prevail
It overwhelmed me, I'm livin' in hell but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Martin, let's get the party
Cracking right here, fuck V.I.P. 
Knowing my baby loves me, home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin' her lies
She ain't surprised at me, she just surprised that we
Been together for this long and I can be
The one to mistreat her, thought it'd last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry, we cry together
[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
From what I recall, we was little niggas
Cuttin' school, gettin' high with the hottest bitches
Livin' life so free, that we ain't fearin' the
Ills of the world and the heat of drug dealin'
You and I then made a killin', and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever a tie this close
Not the love between us, but your love for the dough
You went O.T., started makin' M-O-N-E, why
All my good niggas gotta die?
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
'Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

And I want this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear, 'cause a nigga died happily
My mama warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night she just looked at me, tears in her eyes
And they be saying shit like, "I don't want me baby to die"
Brought so much pain to her life, gotta make it better
'Cause when ma cried, I cried, we cried together

When I cry, you cry, we cry together

The Pledge Remix Lyrics[Intro: Ashanti, Nas & Ja Rule]
There's no me
In the beginnin', it was me (Blastin') Nas (I'm blastin')
I stood alone (Ashanti) but now
Don't you know that I will never leave (Uh)
Murder Inc., y'all (It's Murda, nigga, haha)
It's over now, y'all know that right? (Irv Gotti)
Ill Will, baby (It's Murda)
It's Murda (For life)

[Verse 1: Nas]
My enemies want sorta the same respect I was born with
"God's Son" tatted on my chest, it's permanent
The rap Albert Anastasia
You cowards, y'all want the crown from the Black power man of Asia
Snap out your dreams and prayers of takin' a king's paper
Ask that other rapper how it feel to lose his whole gangsta (How it feel, man?)
You's a no namesta, ya little mans is no threat
You make me upset, I might stank ya (Blastin')
Inc. is the Murder, Ill Will merger let my cash
Make sex with yo' cash, it can't hurt us
Phones ringin' off the hook, Bush and Bloomberg callin' me constant
Streets wanna know the 'cause of that gossip
Nas is lord of the projects 'til the coffin's droppin'
In the ocean like a Amistad slave over boat when
It's a new day, y'all should be scared, I'm back with Stoute
Southside, Queensbridge, the hood's in here
[Chorus: Ashanti & Nas]
There's no me (Uh, talk to me)
Without you (There's no me, y'all)

Leave you (It's no me, y'all)
All I need (I-N-C) need is you
There's no me

[Interlude: Ja Rule, Nas & Ashanti]
Yeah (B-B-B-Blastin')
Let me talk to these niggas, Gotti (I'm blastin')
Yeah, what up Suge? (It's Murda for life)

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
And Lord knows I'll die, I pledge allegiance to homicide
And murder be the case when I kill 'em, why
Would they get a nigga like me started?
I'm regarded the hardest workin' artist since 'Pac (Niggas)
And I ain't talkin' if I'm liked or better
I'm talkin', if he was here, we'd probably ride together
On this chick-ass nigga with curls, bitch dog
Get at me, dog, Rule, nigga, the boss
But you always been a pup now, ain't it a pity
That you runnin' to IG, dyin' to be me?
But I pledge, I-N-C and for the love
I'll bleed it in blood and die from hot slugs, motherfuckers

Without you (Without you)
I can't be (Can't be)
Without you (Can't be)
Don't you know that I will never leave? (I'll never leave)
Leave you (That I'll never leave)
All I need (All I need, all I need), need is you
There's no me (Uh, talk to me)
Without you (There's no me, y'all)
I can't be (I-N-C)
Without you (Ill Will now)
Don't you know that I will never leave? (Talk to me now)
Leave you (It's no me, y'all)
All I need (I-N-C) need is you
There's no me
[Interlude: 2Pac & Ashanti]
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death (Don't you know that I will—)
If I should die before I wake, please, God, walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Outro: Ja Rule & Ashanti]

Murder Reigns Lyrics[Intro: Ja Rule]
Yeah...
I feel the rain comin' down on me niggas, heh...
When the sun gon' shine?
My Lord, somebody help us all, hehehe...

[Chorus: Celeste Scalone (Ja Rule)]
I think the rain is comin' back
I think the reign is comin' murder
(Hahahaha, Ja Rule, baby!)
I think the rain is comin' back
(Last Temptation, time to kill these niggas)
I think the reign is comin' murder
(Dear Lord, can you, feel my pain?)
I think the reign is...
[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
If you can't, it's alright, 'cause I'ma live my life anyway
Just let, it, rain - on me
I feel, so free like a, cool breeze
And when the sun, gon', shine
Fold up the mini-blinds, load up the lucky 9
Hit 'em up from behind
That's, my, life - and it'll never be the same
Ever again, the game is to blame
Don't get caught up in your Range Rover, pullin' over
On the Westside highway shoulder, nigga I'll blow ya
Like a windshield, leave yo' mind on the windshield
And have yo' whip doin' windmills, that's what rain feels like
When it's hittin' a little harder than drizzle
And pickles flyin' out pistols, got niggas cryin' they Christians and
I can't believe shit has come to this
It's unheard of, now it's gonna reign down murder

[Chorus: Celeste Scalone]
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the reign is...

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Yo.. yo..
God only breathes with the best of them, bury the rest of them
A storm is comin', I got a hundred mile runnin' head start
On these niggas 'cause it's murder for life
Drugs, bitches, and money be my only vice
But I'm livin' life in the fast lane, doin' the damn thang
In the Ferrari hard top watchin' Hard Rain
It's a damn shame, no more games
No more love, baby boy I throw back slugs
Through your Green Bay throwback, I hits that up
And let you know where the reign is from
You ever heard of mixin' whiskey with Jamaican rum? You get Biggie
Mix gin with a little cocaine, you got me
And my style is a little too savage to not be
Be looked upon as one of the illest to MC
Y'all niggas want it with me? That shit's unheard of
'Cause niggas, now it's gonna reign down murder
You might also like[Chorus: Celeste Scalone]
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the reign is...

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Nobody loves me...
Sometimes I wish the good Lord would come down and hug me
I take a look at my life, it's gettin ugly
And now I know that you all wanna slug me
I can get above it, it's my life and I dug it
Even though I live it close to the edge
I'm gettin' closer to death, with eve-rrry little step
That I take, in the awake of my last days
I hope the sun shines with a light rain
That would mean the world shared my pain
And now the world could be happy again, smile
'Cause if I ever walk The Green Mile
You can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle
What can I say? I was raised as an only child, lonely
Poppa disowned me, so the streets raised me
To call me crazy is not unheard of
Now it's gonna reign down murder
[Chorus: Celeste Scalone]
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder1Embed

And I think I got you in that same pose pinned up
In a picture painted frame been hangin' love

Wide body had to be built by suburban

Pain is Love Lyrics[Chorus]
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why

[Verse 1]
I sit alone in my four cornered room staring at candles
Gettin hot tryin to handle, this hand that's been dealt to me
I don't need, especially in this world overwhelmed with greed
See we cut from a different tree
Y'all niggas hope and I wish a nigga would fuck with INC
Went through the troubles and the struggle of hustlin and runnin (what)
So the ones that come behind don't' run through nothin
They would fear no man but God and do a lot of frontin
And I'm here to tell the world that pain is lovin'
Like when I die I hope it rains
Cuz if it does, that mean the Lord shared them niggas pain
Here lie our man slain
And I would get out the game if I could
But I promised all my life to my kids I'd make good
Can't stand my father and love my momma
STILL I TRY, God can you explain why
[Chorus]
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why

[Verse 2]
I live my life under pistol, cuz lately love ain't been a issue
With who's gone miss you, when you dead and gone
Will my name live on?
Or will I be the last to die and breathe and eat
'Cause I need a little love and affection and baby
I live like every day was my last one
Dang, I've been living my life... (haha, yea)
Like I'm a leave this world unmarked, smiles combed to horror
For all them days when it rains
And it feels like thangs ain't gettin no better for me
Nobody loves me
Sometimes I wish God could come down and hug me
And wipe the tears from eyes
'Cause in my heart I know only the strong survive
And I die for my family, so they can live a better life
I try, God can you explain why
You might also like[Chorus]
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me

Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me

[Verse 3]
I'll sacrifice my life, fuck all the dumb shit
'Cause being black and broke's gettin redundant
My grow to be a world leader like X and King
If I can live a longer than Pac and BIG
What do river for us niggas run red, you could tell by the lives we live
If it changes it'll be God's prediction
So pain inflicted, like Jane's Addiction
Live right like Christians, but dance with the death
It's like callin' stones a devil, the road is unlevel
Still I walk through the valleys of shadows of death
Gasping for air, breathe in my last breath
My daughter told me first words, my son walked his first steps
And all through life we anticipate death
And if pain is truly love, for my family I DIE
God can you explain why

[Chorus]
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain whyEmbed

Never Again Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
Uh, you make a lot of mistakes in life
Those same mistakes keep callin us back, pullin us in
What the fuck's wrong with niggas?

[Chorus]
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
[But the streets keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]
Never again
[Verse 1]
Will I look a nigga dead in his eyes and know he's dead wrong
And don't leave him dead where he lies
It's a fucked up world we live in
I'm tired of feelin the pain but ain't fightin the feelin
Niggas can you feel me?
Cause in this world I'm alone
And trapped inside this body that's out of control
I'm hittin these streets daily
Know when I got babies to feed rarely seein 'em rarely
This game inhaled me, and like Christ on the slate, nailed me
God, please don't fail me
But it's crazy to ask upon the Lord for help
When I got guns to bust and drugs to sell
I see you in hell, muthafuckas, I ain't bitter
'Cause I know snakes and snitches get it where they slither
My niggas, doin life in the pen
This gotta be what y'all thinkin, shit

[Chorus]
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
[But the streets keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]
Never again
[Cause these hoes keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]
You might also like[Verse 2]
Will I make you cry baby
You know I lie, you can see it in my eyes baby
But the truth is when a woman's fed up
There ain't a damn thing you can do about love
What about us?
Why must our lawyers discuss
Who gets the kids, who gets the cribs
And how we should both live
When I love ya, when we apart all I do is think of ya
But you think I'm fuckin everything that's walkin
Either skirt or the thong
It don't matter, cause in your eyes I'm dog-fuckin 'em all
I got a woman that's gone and a passion for bitches
If you lose one the other becomes your religious
So what am I to do but get the wind behind me
Ground beneath me, make it hard for hoes to reach me
Cause the Rule ain't easy
Babe, unless you're freakin please believe

[Chorus]
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin
[Cause these hoes keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
[But the streets keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]
Never again
[Verse 3]
Will I think these niggas friends and they foes
Cause in this rap game, you never know, just let it go
If my pain is love, my brain's on drugs
And may all my hoes thug on
And keep these punk niggas paralyzed, from the waist down
I got 'em face down is the equivalent of where I'm at now
Over the top of y'all niggas
Just a little quicker and smarter
Enhancin the game makin it harder
For niggas that freeze again like Braxton
I be hittin niggas with thrillers like Mike Jackson
I'm a problem
Number one with a bullet, I keep it up in my gun
It's hollow so when I pull it it numbs
Your whole body
Give it or take a few seconds
You'll probably, be the same nigga to dick ride me
Never again would I close my eyes
And walk through the dark backwards blind

[Chorus]
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
[It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin]

Never againEmbed

We are the world's most dangerous niggas alive

Cuz 50 shots tearing through the side of ya ride
Cuz we are (murderers)
Muthafucka you heard player (murderers)
Popping collars in air

Ready to hold heat, drive-by with Rule
Popping shots through the sun roof screaming "fuck you"

Ain’t It Funny (Murder Remix) Lyrics[Ja Rule]
Murda Inc
Haha it must be the ass
That got me like that
If it get any fatter
Man the rule gonna hafta get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile
In the freakiest manners

Off the wall
Like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

Ain't it funny
It's been awhile since you came around
Now ya wanna see what's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me how ya want my time
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind (on your mind)
See it never had to be this way
You should of never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame
Knowin how the situation changed

[Jennifer Lopez]

Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say

[Jennifer Lopez]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' cuz my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

Daddy’s Little Baby Lyrics[Intro: Ronald Isley]
It's my heart
Pray
Who, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, mhm yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Daddy's little baby, must learn this world is shady
And the color of your skin don't make you less of a lady
Degrade yourself, never, 'cause I'm teaching you better
Life ain't all about cheddar, diamonds, and leather
Understand, you a black sister, in this white man's
World, don't let it get ya, down girl
It's essential that you grow amongst your group
So you don't grow too fast and be doin' Lord knows who
'Cause daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
What I do for a living is a talent I'm given
And I'ma raise you too black, too strong, beautiful
Tell the truth, let you know what women go through
Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gon' cheat
So be careful in the heat, baby girl with cold feet
Keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby, ha, yeah
[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
I'll always (Always), come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby, now and ever, who

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Yo, Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and his chemistry
Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly
Put her over my knee, and let her know this world is yours
Men are dogs, take it from daddy and hold yours
Head high lady, love is 'bout lies and deception
Will always be seen through the eyes
In my demise, don't cry just, hold on
Stay headstrong, and live to learn that life goes on
The day you was born, God answered my cry for help
I look at you a female replica of myself
I was conceived 2/29, you 9/22
God, what's the science in this sign you threw?
I wanna know, just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
So she don't have to come up like I did runnin' loots
Keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby
For real

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
I'll always (Always), come back to you (You know)
I'll always come back to you
I'll always (Well, well, well), come back to you
You're my baby (Yeah), now and ever, woo
I know, I know
You might also like[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
When I look in your eyes, I see stars
It's me and you against the world
Baby, it's in the signs
And anything you want you can get it, daddy's getting it done
You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
And go through rain, sleet, and snow to kiss the sun
Though my travel, through the storm has just begun
Swear to God, when my sister died, I was only five
Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
She came at the time when nobody cared for me
This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully
Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
My little lady, can't quite understand me now
But baby, in time I'll break it down
So keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby
For real

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
I'll always come back to you (Oh, oh)
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever, woo
You know, I love you girl, oh yeah
And I'll always, be there for you girl
You know, you know baby
You're my baby, now and ever
And I'll always, oh, you know, you know, la-la-la-la, yeah
You're my baby, now and ever
And you know, you know, baby, know
You see I love you, girl
You're my little baby girl, yeah
You're my baby, now and ever
And I know, you know, you know
Oh you know, always, oh, always

Real Life Fantasy Lyrics[Intro]
Real life, real life
Fantasy, fantasy

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I'm a rock star, Rick James, Mick Jagger
Bright lights, big stages, bad habits
Get high, go to prison, and evade taxes
This is not what I envisioned when I started rapping
Fuck the mansions, the phantoms, the suites, the cabanas
'Cause none of that matters when the mirror shatters
All I see is pieces of me scattered
Is it a miracle, or is it madness?
Because when I puts it all together it reflects this
And this is me
About as close you gonna get to insanity, or genius
My real life fantasy
[Chorus: Anita Louise]
Is this my life, or am I dreaming
I can't lie, I don't believe it
Oh, I don't believe it
Oh, is this my life?

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
The talk of the fantasies, the more twisted the memories
I never thought Gotti would leave the game like D-R-E
Never thought 'Shanti would ever stop repping the team
And how the the fuck is Lloyd hooking up with the enemies?
If this was '03 I would have told you you was crazy
If you told me this is what it would be
I miss Vita, Caddi, Black Child, Charlie
I thought we were tighter then the Marley's: family
But I guess you can't be
In an industry that breeds nothing but envy
Jealousy, please nobody befriend me!
In my real life fantasy

[Chorus: Anita Louise]
Is this my life, or am I dreaming
I can't lie, I don't believe it
Oh, I don't believe it
Oh, is this my life?

I'm on this money these bitches the upper echelon
I'm on one, reality's on one
It's a thin line, here's to Christian

[Chorus: Anita Louise]
Is this my life, or am I dreaming
I can't lie, I don't believe it

The Crown Lyrics[Hook: Sizzla] + [Ja ad libs]
They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take may crown (let's get to the song)

Who Ja' Bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officer askin for a search
They found no weapon, just only a draw first
[Ja Rule: Verse 1]
I know y'all niggas is second guessin the state I'm in
Bitch, I'm in to makin' hit records that spin like rims
So when "Flex" get it, he bomb it once, shit bomb it twice
New York city park your cars, turn off your lights
And flicker your hazards, cause when Rule' spit to the masses
I got yo attention like J-Lo's ass

[Jamacian Talking and Shots Fired]

[Ja Rule: Verse 2]
I know y'all niggas is second guessin the state I'm in
Bitch, I'm in to makin hit records that spin like rims
So when "Flex" get it, he bomb it once, shit bomb it twice
New York city park your cars, turn off your lights
And flicker your hazards, cause when Rule' spit to the masses
I got yo attention like J-Lo's ass
And if it's pussy we talkin' I come to smash em'
Personal foul like Kobe, when I sexual harass em'
Cause bitches want you beat it with passion
Niggas want to you to clip up and clap em'
Hide the body like nuthin' happened
Niggas need to get they money and stick to rappin'
Or end up like one of the Jackson's beware of your actions
Cause you don't wanna meet that desert e'
With that hair pin trigger so easy to squeeze
And no matter how you cut me I'm always chesse
Like "Black" said, It's a hundred and eighty-seven degrees

Race Against Time Lyrics[Chorus]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

[Verse 1]
God, why the hell am I here?
Is it a blessin', or a painful lesson of life and its directions?
Date of conception, two twenty-nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Look into these eyes and witness lives tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock, there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was cash money
So that I lust for
Be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven, that I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip, but you be there to pick me up
Down I'm on my knees like what's up
Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence
Got me to a better sense, cause what's yours is mines
Hear me, Lord, I'm runnin' out of time
[Chorus]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

[Verse 2]
Nobody cry for me, cause I
Wanna see you smile for me when I die
Look through my windows to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world, which is so cold
Take me, save me, before I'm crazy
The only reason I live is for my baby
Never did you tell me that, life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this, shit might be changed
But now, I'm just racin' against time tryin' to survive
And see why, y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie
Get drunk and stay high
Don't de-nigga-ny
Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me, Lord, I'm runnin' out of time

Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

[Verse 3]
I fears no man, but when its time to go, I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness, learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light, but all I see is the night
When everything else is bright
What happened to my life?
Is this what I am? Is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire
Within my soul I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny, maybe one day
I'll give this world the best of me
You know I never been one to judge right or wrong
I embraced and showed you love
Then I throw slugs at the other side
Go get 'em in broad daylight
What a nigga would give to live my life
You don't want it, cause if you could get it you would try
Feel me, Lord, Ja has arrived
[Chorus]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot

The Manual Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You talk too much shit
You know niggas always talkin bout bitches ain't shit
Money over bitches
We give all our money to the bitches any fuckin way
(I love my bitch)
So I'ma send some love out
To the bitches, holla

[Verse 1]
Shit, here's somethin to remember
When we met that day in September
But, you've been gone since November
Had to finish out yo' last college semester
Her major - brokerage investor
She probably go broke tryin to invest her
Time and money in somethin that she call love
Cause, she love fuckin with thug niggas
That alwasy get high and had to be drug dealers
Eventually, she hooked up with some hood bitches
The hood bitches turned her on to strippin
Now the, gettin is good and it's well understood
That money on the wood can make things get harder
Be glad I'm not a pimp, if I was I'd charge ya
But for all that you go through, just thought I'd let you know
Hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu
[Chorus]
Niggas need to read the man-u-al
To seperate your housewife from a hoe
Cause there's no rules to this shit here
Am I makin myself clear?
What she don't know won't hurt her y'all
So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too

[Verse 2]
You know what they say right?  Bitches ain't shit
And all men are dogs cause we just wanna fuck
Sundown to sun up, one up on a hoe
I might go down on the low, that's just me though
From L-A-X to Heathrow, I'm one of them niggas
That really doesn't need no, introduction
When I met her she was "Girl, Interrupted"
Grew up became a woman not to be trusted
Frustrated and flustered, living amongst
These thieves hoes and hustlers, I'm diggin what's next
She had a studio apartment in the projects
With her and her girl from D.C. used to bus checks
And hold the coke, her niggas ain't sold yet
In hopes the copes don't know about all this
Shiiiiit, for all that you go through
Just wanna let you know, hoes need love too

Niggas need to read the man-u-al

So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too

[Verse 3]
Fake nails, fake breasts, fake eyes too
It's oh-four, and that's kinda what we used to
But you don't holla back like you used to, but I ain't mad at cha
I'm happy for a bitch, even if I can't have her
I remember when you was down in Atlanta
Workin gentlemen's clubs and you didn't even know what a gentlemen was
Forty to love and I wanna serve
That body like Serena's with less curves
But actions speak louder than words, and you gettin your money
Mami every month, 15th and 1st
Shit could be worse, you could be in the struggle
Or born with no ass and have nothin to hustle
Go on flex your muscle, cause that ain't the case is it?
Go on get your paper keep flossin on these bitches
Cause for all that you go through
Just thought I'd let you know, hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu
[Chorus]
Niggas need to read the man-u-al
To seperate your housewife from a hoe
Cause there's no rules to this shit here
Am I makin myself clear?
What she don't know won't hurt her y'all
So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too

Things Gon’ Change Lyrics[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
First off, fuck the snitch and that Unit he claim
Fuck Dre partial, and Eminem
Plus the world heard it before, they tired of them
And they waitin' for that thug shit from Rule again
And "Proof" can bomb proof your hummer then
Put a vest on yourself and your chill-dren
You should be scared of death of them murderin'
Niggas who like to put lil' holes thorugh kids'
In case y'all ain't heard about my savages
They'll kidnap yo kids throw em' over a bridge
Got em' reminiscing to N-O-T-O-R-I-O
U-S, you just, lay down slow
I blaze out in the six while letting the fifth go
I think "BIG" as if I was wanted on "Death Row"
We the world famous, Murder Inc. we infamous
Fo' making bangers and, and bangin hammers shit

Always On Time (Remix) Lyrics(Ashanti) [Ja Rule talking]
Always there when you call [Buck-shots, haha]
Always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby

(Chorus - Ashanti)
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
(Ja Rule)
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter-past three
And shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in hoops and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti]
But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

(Chorus)

(Jay-Z)
Hov!
Big Pimpin'
Walk with a small limp
And I'm here to scoop you broads out your mid-sized cars
Bring hoes out of the closet
My dough gives chicks motive
He got enough money to afford it!
But one thing you could say about Jay
It's not a day I ever bought it
Y'all can audit my life
I put on that on my unborn daughter's life
All I give 'em is game
I don't give 'em my name
Chicks leap through hula-hoops to get in the flame
All it takes is Cristal juice to get in they pants, man
Ain't nothin' gon' change 'bout Hov
But my socks, my drawers, and my Rocawear clothes
And of course the flows
So pretty soon I'll be able to rap in Morse Code (beep beep, beep beep)
Please believe me
But enough about Jay
My resume speaks for itself
Get your keys we leavin'
Hov!

Oh I'm, feelin' like you livin' a, double life
Cause you don't be comin' home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin' for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti]
But who cares, you care

(Chorus)
(Ashanti)
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mineEmbed

Look in his eyes, and squeeze like fuck it
And just to think my niggas do this shit for nuthin'
When my wild Rule' thuggins, lookin' to get a come up
Come on in and catch the angel that's all in
Call me Lord remis' my time, and I'll arrive with

But you do understand trailer parks and cocaine
Disrespcting your mother what fuckin part of

So we got it, and now I gotta put 'em in the grave

Pray 4 The Day Lyrics[Hook: Leah Siegal]
Pray for the day, your pain goes away
And for the time, wasted on goodbye
Can't get back the time, but you stay on my mind
Forgive me for the lies, and all the tears you've cried

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
So I pray, every night for a better day
It's like the world's Ike and I'm Annie Mae
But ain't no bitch here, though I shed so many tears for ya
Only cause a nigga care for ya
I'm talking 'bout the world over, wake me when it's all over
I don't know if it gets any colder, or any warmer
I'm weak, but I'm getting stronger
Forever young, but I'm getting older
Lend me your shoulder, but I don't wanna cry on it
But at times I feel a need to lie on it; closure
And some things will never change
I could be last, but still way ahead of the game
I do my bid to go hot like 'Pac like Wayne
Like Rick like Ray even mo'fuckin' James
I'm just sayin', love is pain
And all I ask of y'all is keep Rule in your prayers
[Hook: Leah Siegal]

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Hope to see you when I get there
Mile high heavenly skies will be a breath of fresh air
G5, nobody on my plane cause it's private
On my way to St. Elsewhere
I swear, I know they say the good die young and
I guess that's why I'm so scared
But I refuse to die and I won't die
Until history records my greatness; Amen
I see angels, I see demons
I hear laughter, people screaming
Makes me wonder what's my reason for being here
And so I'm kneeling

[Hook: Leah Siegal]

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Sing a prayer for me
But don't nobody shed a tear for me, I'm dying inside as it is if
Lonely is the way of the walk then
I'm practically lying in a coffin
How often do you tell someone you love 'em?
I bet not as often as you say you love summer
And it's gonna be the coldest winter ever while I'm locked up
See y'all in 18, one love and fuck fame

Life Ain’t A Game Lyrics[Hook x2]
Life ain't a game (nooooo)
If you feelin me (say yeah-yea)
Flip the bird where (in the aiiir)
Fuck the world (we don't caaare)

[Ja Rule]
It's time to ride out
Niggas stash your cash at the hideout
The Murderous I-N-C's en route

(I'm really) the nigga that you need to get with
Cuz y'all pop shit nigga, I pop clips nigga
Hot, but not the black four-dot-six nigga
You know the Rule, thug heart nigga
And I don't need no fake friends, broke ties, loose ends
There they go niggas is at it again
Tryin to befriend the nigga that they claim they love, but hate so much
And really all we got is us
But fuck it, it's the same way they fucked me
Now I'm fuckin your broad in the back of a Humvee, go figure
I'll have your niggas pourin out liqour
All because you fuckin with the Rule nigga
[Hook x2]

[Ja Rule]
Take my life, take my mind
Take my heart, take my soul
Take my cash, take it all
But save me
I'm throwing my life away

[Ja Rule]
Why, would a nigga with so much talent
Want to throw it all away to drugs and violence
I know not the answers but I ask the questions
Do all Muslims really study their leasons?
And how many Christians lie during confessions?
I know I did when I was just a kid
Never told about the guns my uncle hid
Under my bed, and at night I played with them
Kind of grew up to be sort of a loose cannon
Before my sins, I'm asking you to let me in
Lord help me, I been through all the pain
Now I wanna know who loves me

[Hook x2]

[Ja Rule]
Changes, changes
My mind is going through
Changes, changes
My body's going through
Changes, changes
My life is going through
Changes, changes

Livin’ It Up (Ft. Case) LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah

To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uh
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, ah
C'mon
Baby, you're such a typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma fuck, you tonight thing
Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, I'ma leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangstas and hoes go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky
Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?

The bitch got a little too high
Picked up my ride and started crackin'
The radio blastin' +Between Me And You+
But you ain't on the low with that freak shit you do

I'm so ignorant 'cause I done played my last tears
And pain is bliss been through so many things
It's hard to resist a mind that's currently
Thinking on his last wish it's nothing to fuck with
When I know what I want because you must think I'm a fool
Claiming you love what I do and be out playing the Rule
Bad move, more cars, more hoes, more jewels, and I'd love
Nothin' more than to see you (6 feet underground) doesn't
Matter how we gonna get outta weed rollin' it outta windows
Nor from Adam? but we show them uh now we leave them niggas
Creating a deal let it open so won't be goin' (6 feet underground)

Yo, cock sucka', I get squat and post and cock tha nina'

Take crazy for genius, hated like Jesus Christ
My weakness always been bad bitches
And new bills with creases, my thesis more than extraordinary
And that nigga that got shot nine times could tell ya that I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, God may I ask yo' permission to take his life
This is grown man be "I" N-C to R-U-L-E extraordinary, one for the ages
When done sawed off the front of them gauges
To engage in combat
To send you and 'fem' where your moms at
Motherfucka you hear that
And I ain't talkin about them heavenly skies
I'm talkin' about fire from nines
Or maybe the fifty cal' cause you like five-oh
Or maybe somewhere in Cal where you like to lay low
You bitch made, done heard about that bitch
You been slayin', layin' up with, some where right off of Sunset
Y'all haven't heard yet that nigga change is loose
And I got proof, get it? "I got Proof"

Yo, I'm small lil' homies, frail but bold
Went from base to some bullshit like "Jalen Rose"
Got my blind D-O-G's readin' brail and coats
Keep tha heat in tha winter I can't tell it's cold
Clean my set, pieced out flame the TEC
Throw shots out niggas catch like "Wayne Cherbet"
Son of a gangsta, Talk dirty son I'm a bang ya
I'm tha truth with tha ox, keep gum on tha banger
Hussein, the only reason hoes chase tha thugs
Nigga blade part two I got tha taste for blood
Log on Fatal.com, see fatal drop bombs
More militant minded then y'all faded with 'Pac rhymes
Clutching tha stick beam, suckin' tha stick green
Out tha window or tha sunroof, buckin' tha sixteen
You ain't a gangsta 'Em', this is gangsta shit
And "50" you ain't nuthin' but a gangsta bitch
"Pac'" would have never did no song with no wanksta snitch
He confusin' y'all he ain't tha shit

Where I’m From Lyrics[Lloyd]
Umm hey, comin from Where I'm From (I'm from) ohhh yea

[Ja Rule]
Kids get killed in ghettos, shot up over their Carmelo's
While they mom was at home, tears hittin the pillow
Reverend in the middle of a sermon and funereal
Shed a tear cause they  lost a son the same way a year ago
It's the same egospiritual, we thuggin in harmony
They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery
If I'm wrong pardon me, me I'm just tired of poverty
Why them niggas in the hood never hit the lottery
Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft
First we dustin off the rounds and we slip in the mag'
Then we slip on the masks, and go out and mash
And we call it feeding our family
Ya'll call it a tragedy, Damn
How I could just kill a man
His blood flow like a river and rinse his blood off of my hand
If you hearing me speak please Lord give me a chance
Please forgive me of my sins, cause we cleansed where I'm from
[Hook] - [Lloyd]
Me and my niggas ride
Even when the sun don't shine and its cold outside
I never run in or hide, cause some niggas hate it
But I can't get faded cause I done made it
Instead of struggling or strive
Survive my weight how these ghetto streets of mine
This is coming from Where I'm From (I'm from)
We all walk back in line (yeah)

[Ja Rule]
Now everybody know that everybody said nobody can hide from beef
Except but us, who surprised when these kids get killed on the streets
Look how these animals eat that's how they talk bout us
While they shed they joke and laugh puttin a choke round us
Can I get a moment of SILENCE
Cause they claimin it's the Murderers that's causing all the violence
What bout the ones that protect to serve our honor
Poppin the blue colla', with shots soon to follow
The ghettos in horror, cause in this boy shot went back
And now the neighborhood hot and he can't move the crack
When it's all about the dollars
And he'll individually get murdered cause money is power
But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours
Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the Island
He was only 13, but tried as an adult in the highest of courts
Cause ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from
You might also like[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
We ain't all killers in prison
Matter fact that's a stereo typical thought of livin
Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it
Summer time top down with the wood finish
Pushin hard uptown windows slightly tinted
Back to back Benz and jeeps, blowin weed with my niggas
On our way to a house party, gonna fuck with some bitchs
Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken
And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak em, and do it every
Other weekend
If I don't have to kill niggas, I never would leave the ghetto
I'm like an angel that put on a halo, cradle the grave of my niggas that we
Lost in the ghetto
Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and nike's
Roll 3 dice and name our dope ice cream
Set trends and ya'll follow our lead
But in New Yitti niggas follow they dreams, where I'm from

[Hook]

Now I lay me down and sleep
And I pray to the Lord, for my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take (Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take)

Dial M for Murder Lyrics[Ja Rule]
Gotti, here we go again, yo..

[Verse 1]
Two two-nine and seventy-six, get off my dick, niggas I'm born
The future problem's, kickin and carryin on
Cause I got blood in my lungs and can't breathe, just conceived
And a nigga already fixin to leave
This ungodly world - and to think, I got a baby girl
To raise, in this deadly era of AIDS
Just yesterday we were slaves, and good friends
Now that we got ends that don't meet niggas we will meet again
I wanna know why, the shit gets said
The shit gets wrote, the shit gets read, motherfuckers get fed
I shed a tear for my rider, cause thugs cry
And the truth'll shatter niggas pride like cold lies
Can I live? Dog, why you wanna stop the Rule from risin?
And I G for me, surprise and growl
At the young that you called a liar
Now I'm the king of this jungle, no more denyin
Talk to the iron if you wanna holla, I'll pop at you
Probably, piercin your bone when you poppin your collar
Cause this is, pain over love, my style's brain on drugs
Yo' style's can't catch up to Rule niggas whassup?
Motherfucker
[Hook: Ja Rule]
When the gun blows, and the shots fall
When the smoke clears, we'll be right here
Screamin murder (murda!) Know it's murder (murda!)
Murder (fuck y'all!) We'll be right here (you hear?)
When the gun blows (c'mon!) and the shots fall (c'mon!)
When the smoke clears (murda!) we'll be right here (murda!)
Screamin murder (yeah!) Know it's murder (yeah!)
Murder - we'll be right here - cause it's.. MURDER!!!!

[Verse 2]
Yeah.. yeah..
M'uhfuckers y'all want problems, c'mon, I'm the nigga to give 'em
Niggas don't want none of the Rule they know how hard I'm hittin
Why should I bother with 'em
When they ain't touchin what I'm doin?
I'm takin this rap game, to levels that's unhuman (c'mon niggas)
I'm a beast, with animalistic, intentions
And the best of y'all niggas is honorable mentions
Standin next to I-N-C, niggas
Y'all fear we, rap's first organized crime family
Sellin more records than dope, these days apparently
Got bitches on both coasts, we don't fuck sporadically
How you gon' handle me? I'm pushin your pill
Crossin 'em over, shoot from the corner, three mill'
I'm the franchise deal that bust hotter than burners
Y'all niggas want it come and get it
But just know motherfuckers it's - MURDER!!!!

Love Me, Hate Me Lyrics[Intro]
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
This world loves me, this world loves me not
I'm torn between the best of both 'cause I'm hot
In this game so brittely, literaly
I got niggas wanna riddle me, get rid of me
R-U-L-E, need I say more?
World, hope y'all prepared for the chaos
'Cause y'all want the beast in me, so I'ma give it
Paint pictures vivid, live high as a spirit
Y'all can all jump in it
That's what you might as well do
If you gonna live life timid
And I ain't never been intiminated
Believe me, and I don't wanna fuckin breath easy
I wanna make it hard for these niggas
So when they can't stand me
I'ma make it so these niggas can't feed they family
Now do you love me, or do you hate me?
C'mon and get me, I keep it off safety
[Chorus]
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come

[Verse 2]
There's nothin' but love spread between me and my niggas
We bust guns together and fuck so many bitches
But I know that Hell is callin
In the name of the Lord just let a nigga in
'Cause I ain't done nothin' wrong, but love thy self
And harm other niggas that wanna stop my health
Is that failure?
'Cause love'll never be hand over hand
It's man versus man
It's Murda
If I'm gonna be hated or to be loved
I prefer ta live wild and die from slugs
What you want from me?
Lord I'm only a human
Tho I bear your name, I'm a devil in chains
Release me, 'cause Lord only knows it ain't easy
When I'm scarred for life, I know that he sees me
Now do you love me nigga
Or do you hate me nigga
C'mon and get me
I'm waiting nigga

I know y'all fiendin' for more, and I'm not done
As long as I can run through current like state times
Keep up a sane mind, and hand on my iron, I'ma blast off mine
Look in the eyes of a nigga who seldomly cries
I got a beautiful wife and kids, why me?
Got cash, jewels, cars, and cribs, why me?
If this good livin' Lord, why me?
When I live so dirty yet I'm worthy to be
Number one, the world's only begotten son

Passion Lyrics[Intro]
I know ya'll love me
Let's go

[Hook]
Nobody loves me
Sometimes the world can seem so cold
Looking through the windows of my soul
I see the truth and now I know (I know, I know, I know)
Y'all gotta love me
When the weight of the world was on my shoulders
You were there
When it got heavy, I held it
You were there
The ones that stood by me like soldiers
You were there
I know you love me
[Verse 1]
But I'm still waiting for the Lord to come hug me
Send a sign or somethin'
Is it all for nothin'?
The talent and passion of mine
I'm sick of sufferin'
I know your plans is greater than mine
So I'm asking
Why do you want me dead or alive?
And how could you let the people see me through the enemy's eyes?
Like, jealousy, envy, Feds wanna convict Gotti
I'm thinking probably we was gettin' too much money
Too many niggas in whips sittin' on 20's
Too much connections to the streets, Y'all niggas doin' somethin'
And after overall assumptions, so it's all or nothin'
Ain't nothin' stopping the second coming, except the coffin
I may be incased, but even from there I still touch 'em
Niggas ain't promised tomorrow, that's why we still hustle
For all my niggas that can't be here
For every tear, say me a prayer, I swear

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
But what's love, when your friends become enemies
Your nightmares are no longer your worst dreams
And as bad as everything seems
Keep hustling
We gon' get it by any means
How unfortunate, January the sixth
Federal officers, raided our offices
Making it hard for us to eat, and breathe, and live
And they swear they got niggas that's informin' them
They've been handin' down indictments for about a year
And they send nobody to jail yet, we still in the clear
And the Bible that said, "Thou shall not fear no man, but God"
Whoever said that, ain't never faced the law
And why all these Feds probin' going on
I'm fighting niggas, swingin' back against the wall
That's for my niggas that can't be here
For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear
You might also like[Hook]

[Verse Three]
How could you hate me, why would the Lord forsake me
Put the weight of the world on my shoulders
I thinkin' I could brush it off and nobody notice
Keep raisin' my kids: Britney, Jeffry, and Jordan
Keep coppin' new whips: Bentleys, Benzes, and Porshes
My niggas, and my fans is the only thing of importance
It's crazy how the world turns
Sometimes, you gotta light up and let it burn
Sweep up your ashes, put 'em up in a urn
On a mantle from memories
I hear you callin' me, Lord knows you love me
The Passion of Rule is so real, just lend me your ear
You'll feel what I feel, you'll tear when I tear
The vision's real clear, just look in my eyes
I believe in putting my life in the hands of God
For all my niggas that can't be here
For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear

[Hook]

Niggas & Bitches Lyrics[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]
Yeah ... ha, uh huh
You know how we do (we're gonna do how we do)
Uh, uh, yo my nigga Cad what's hangin nigga (gangsta shit)
Nigga Terry what's goin on nigga
Let me talk to 'em for a minute (Murder Inc. bosses in the building)
Yeah, haha

[Chorus]
Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about the benjamins and nobody ain't doin it like us
C'mon what y'all want?
Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder
Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners
Cocked and let go!

[Verse 1]
Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense
Bomb roof and vehicles and clonin Ems
But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs
A horror show, yeah picture this
Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again

[Chorus]
You might also like[Verse 2]
Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos
Cause I don't love these hoes
I'm above and beyond everything that your seein
And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin
If I could be one of the seasons, you'd call me summer
The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin down the foundation for what's really hot
Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)
I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)
My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art
And nobody can really tell the twins apart
I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria
I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya
My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia
Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads
So I push the Porsche high and truck to court
Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision
I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens
It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs
Around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched
Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters
But I don't do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more
Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours
And y'all niggas is teasin, y'all don't really want war
But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more
[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro - Ja Rule - talking]
Faggots, haha (Panna Banana what up)
Yeah, shout out to my nigga 01 (my nigga Holla, I see you baby)
Baby, you know what I mean? My nigga Black Child (Joe, what up nigga)
Big Caddillac, my motherfuckin partner my brother
What up Gotti, you know how we gonna do these niggas
You ain't got to pick up no mic either my nigga
I got this, I got these niggas Gotti
Holla back nigga (*laughing*)
Yeah, uh, yo my nigga Burns in the building
